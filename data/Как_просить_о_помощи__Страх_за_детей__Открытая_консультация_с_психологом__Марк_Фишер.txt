Speaker A: I'm just going to cry a lot because there's a lot of pain inside. This, too, will probably not be interesting for everyone to watch. But not the point. Lots of poly. There are many such experienced moments, quite serious. It's all connected mainly with my children. As if it all started right from their birth. It's a premature birth there. Resuscitation, and for a long time on the verge of life and death. It's all a long acceptance. As I read somewhere, there is a very good image of this when you fly to Bali, and all this in anticipation. That's exactly how I lived. All this time, all my pregnancy, I was just in some kind of euphoria. For me it was something so incredible right. It was a miracle, it was magic. For the first time in my life I encountered, yes, not in childhood with some kind of magic, but right now. And your plane, you're flying to Bolivia. And your plane lands in Honduras. And you're like, I didn't want to go to Honduras. Why? It happened to me, it's all that. That's how it would all start. For my psyche, it was like this. I wouldn't be ready at all.
Speaker B: A very vivid metaphor about Bolivia and Honduras. And what was Honduras in this case?
Speaker A: Gonturasom is that instead of the joy of the birth of your children, you have grief, because I have been born for two months at all. Well, as if there were no predictions, whether the children will survive or not, what the consequences will be. Well, because there were a lot of diagnoses there. They said that how will you carry them, there, two wheelchairs at the same time. there was a lot there. In general, somehow they slowly got out of it there, it turned out that everything was not so terrible. But then there were several more such episodes. For example, like this. A perfect evening, my children are having fun, bathing in the bath there, having fun. I feel so good, that's what a good evening. Nothing bad, the children are healthy, everything is fine. I go into the bath to admire them, and then I just have a baby, I see that she was standing, standing and falling into the bath. And I pick it up. In general, he had a cardiac arrest. Well, that is... as if some new ones are revealed there, that is, we are fighting something there, yes, we will somehow get out of some problems, some others manifest themselves, and they are all like this, how to say something, deadly diseases, yes, it's not easy, well, something you can live with, but really Such a lottery, they told me there, you need to put a pacemaker, your decision. Well, either wait, it will outgrow or not. And I'm, well, as if from this shock there, I didn't have time to go. Then you have to make a decision. Either, as it were, this is already a disability for life, yes. Or wait, it will level out, yes. And you, if you make the wrong decision, then you can lose, well, like this. For the psyche, all this is very difficult, at least for mine. And then here I find out, for example, that a lot of deaths occur, well, it's basically there they told me who has epilepsy, yes, here, for example, People die, for example, not because of their illness, yes, here a person has epilepsy, yes, and he had an attack in the bathroom, and he died not because of epilepsy, but because he choked. And so I just survived, for example, well, I didn't survive, but I'm trying, there, the brain is trying to sort of cope with one here... that there was a cardiac arrest, that's the situation, we need to make a decision. And who will tell you how to do the right thing? No one, just you. And now he's just struggling with the task with me, and then I recognize this situation. And I have such a next wave there that if I hadn't been there at that second, then, yes, I wouldn't have had a child anymore, it would have just drowned. And there have been 5 or 6 such situations in my life over the past 6 years, and I just don't have time to cope with them. And now this pain is accumulating, and I already understand that I'm not responding adequately there, very emotionally. Very expensive. They are expensive. And even some joyful moments when I have to be happy for them, I am not as happy as all parents. Wow, cool, well done. And I'm in tears, for God's sake. Well, you know, everything. too emotional, too. I want to be a normal, adequate person who doesn't cry like that at matinees, yes, but just rejoices. Well, in short, I want to get rid of this pain, to become calm, adequate, normal, that's how you can calmly speak, yes, calmly, slowly, measured. God, I can't do this, I don't even dream about it.
Speaker B: That's it in a nutshell. You live in a situation of constant uncertainty, it turns out. It seems to me that it is quite difficult to be a calm, balanced and happy person in what is happening? In the sense that your experiences seem to me absolutely appropriate, absolutely understandable.
Speaker A: I want it differently. I have one life, right? Can this be justified? Everything is clear. I also say that I am not an iron man. It's all clear. But I want to fix it so that my children can see a happy mom. They are the nerves of the eternally afraid. Here we still have such a moment. Also one of. All children have chickenpox. We also had chickenpox. We had a lot of fun. We were painting some faces there. Well, we had fun, in general. We had post-stroke encephalitis after that, that is, we did not recover like all normal people, but we went to the hospital, and this is also a very terrible disease, it is brain inflammation, and the consequences are also unpredictable. And there was also a moment when they took a puncture there from the spine, the child's legs failed there, she did not walk. That is, again, yes, here we are having fun at home, everything is fine, she takes me to the hospital, and then my child's legs fail, and well, as if after that, well, thank God, everything is there. I recovered, after that we were told that your highest temperature is 38, 39, 40 ï¿½ that's it, it's already meningitis. And now I'm like... like this, I touch it all the time, they say, I would... check the temperature there all the time, yes, because I'm afraid to miss it. A little gawking, yes, and that's it. And minus one child, yes. Well, well, it's... in general... so, that's why I'm in such tension all the time, all the time I'm there 10 times to be safe, that's it. Well, that's paranoia, right? Practically already.
Speaker B: Well, paranoia is when you're afraid... of her.
Speaker A: Justified, but, damn, that's exactly what it looks like.
Speaker B: Well, paranoia is when you're afraid of something that can't happen. You are afraid of very real things, as far as I hear, unfortunately.
Speaker A: You see, and I can't help but pass, and I will live my whole life in fear. And it is broadcast anyway to children too. And I don't want to... How to say? You can live in different ways. Yes, you can live in fear all the time, but you can get rid of it and live happily. That's what I want to do, actually.
Speaker B: Do you have any outside support?
Speaker A: Spouse, parents, someone?
Speaker B: No. And how did it happen?
Speaker A: Well, the spouse left, or rather, yes. Now we are more enemies.
Speaker B: Enemies?
Speaker A: Well, yes, because Dad thinks I'm making up all these diseases. I have absolutely calm children. He thinks I'm a big dreamer and doesn't want to take it. I would say so, because from the very beginning, the children were born, there the doctor voiced some diagnoses, he said, no, no, no, I don't want to hear anything about it, and left. I mean, I think he just doesn't want to live in this Honduras, that's all.
Speaker B: So he thinks you're exaggerating?
Speaker A: They communicate with children via WhatsApp, they smile, everything is fine. They are outwardly absolutely cheerful and healthy children. Who does not know all our diagnoses and will never notice even one child with a disability due to cerebral palsy. Thank God, this is an easy degree. It's just that the child is limping a little. These are absolutely normal, funny children. And Dad perceives them that way. Well, because he sees them on Skype once a month. He doesn't even know all this, and I don't even tell him. Because, you know, there will be something in response... He says you're sick yourself, you're a fool yourself, you'll come up with all this and so on. Therefore, no, there is definitely no support there. I just don't think people will understand who I was trying to tell. I didn't find any support.
Speaker B: Support in the sense of some kind of separation, separation of your experiences?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: And what do you think people experience when you tell them this?
Speaker A: People don't want to know other people's problems. Or they don't know how to support. What words are not very good at. I don't know, probably. I don't really know how to support myself, to be honest.
Speaker B: How would you like to be supported? What kind of support would be useful or necessary for you?
Speaker A: I don't know how to support them, like probably most people, and I don't know myself what I would be. For me, support is help, first of all. Because I am alone, and there are always some procedures in the massage, speech therapists, speech pathologists, ticket specialists. To get out of all these situations, you need to constantly work with them. and to work for me, and to earn for all this, of course, support for me, probably it's more, well, something so material, yes, well, and a kind word, of course, but also help, exactly, I don't know, there, to prompt some doctors, well, here such, practical, probably so.
Speaker B: Do you apply for this help?
Speaker A: No. No one. I tried at first, there are some social centers for the disabled there, but this is generally all by. No.
Speaker B: I haven't applied. And what didn't work out?
Speaker A: Well, that's all, everything that is state, social, that's all, how to say it, it doesn't work. There are massage therapists there, I kind of invite a masseur to the house for a fee, who knows how to work with children with cerebral palsy. And there, well, we looked like massage rooms here, I understand, it's just a waste of time. In general, all this is past, we need to look for specialists ourselves, from whom there will be a sense.
Speaker B: It's like you're alone in this.
Speaker A: Yes, absolutely. I once heard such a phrase that it is not necessary to make a tragedy out of my motherhood when I tried to share. It's probably easier for me to explain something myself than to prove something to someone, because basically, I say that people even, well, sort of say, yes, you're exaggerating, but no. Here are the statements, here are the doctors writing diagnoses. Come on, no one examines their children like that somehow. I even have an Institute, RAHFUS, said one doctor of science, leave your children alone, they are completely healthy with me. Nothing that a child has a disability is just not given. Well, in general, no, I understand that you can't put all that knowledge into other people's heads, everything that I had to go through, listen to doctors, reread all medical literature. It's a lot of effort for someone to understand what's really going on... But how about you.
Speaker B: I think I understand you?
Speaker A: I don't know, you haven't told me how you feel about this. And how can I understand when you just ask me questions? If you had said something... And you.
Speaker B: Can you formulate a question so that I can answer?
Speaker A: No, I think it's a slightly different situation. Well, don't you know my children? Have you seen them? How can you?
Speaker B: I see your feelings.
Speaker A: It's all video, probably. But if you looked at my children, you would say maybe the same thing. That everything is super. Look how cheerful they are. They look very good.
Speaker B: I would somehow condemn you, do you suppose?
Speaker A: I would assume that you... No, I didn't condemn it, but I just didn't believe it, like everyone else.
Speaker B: And didn't believe in what?
Speaker A: That there are problems that need to be dealt with, that need to be worked on.
Speaker B: I believe your feelings, I believe your tears, I believe the pain you're talking about. The factual side of the issue does not matter much in this case. I can see that it's hard for you, that it's very hard for you, and that you feel isolated from the world around you. You feel lonely. without outside support. You feel misunderstood, rejected.
Speaker A: I don't need anyone to understand me.
Speaker B: It seems to me that this is exactly what you need. Because that's the only way you can be helped. Here, I'm sitting across from you. I'm a psychologist. You share your pain with me, you share your pain with me. And all I can do is empathize with you. I can somehow stay close to your pain.
Speaker A: That's it? I wanted to hear from you at least how to get rid of it myself. Do you think empathy is all you need?
Speaker B: That's all there is to it.
Speaker A: How about me? To work with yourself. Maybe this will also help somehow.
Speaker B: No? There is such wisdom that grief divided into two is half of grief. And you carry a very big grief with you.
Speaker A: It's fine if I can't share it with anyone. Is there any other way out? No? Nobody needs someone else's grief.
Speaker B: I need your grief.
Speaker A: No one will take it from me.
Speaker B: Do you believe me? I need your grief. I am ready to share your grief with you.
Speaker A: No, I don't believe it.
Speaker B: You have an explanation for why you feel... Something that happens to you is impossible to somehow understand, accept and share.
Speaker A: So, now I don't understand, once again.
Speaker B: Do you have any thoughts about why you think, why you think, why you feel that your condition is impossible to share, accept, understand?
Speaker A: Because, by and large, no one cares about each other. because from my environment. Yeah, well, yeah.
Speaker B: And who taught you this in your environment?
Speaker A: Yes, everything, actually. You know, I thought of someone as my friends, that's just when I have a child in Irina, well, like, there was such a situation, we're going on vacation again, I'm like this, all uauauau vacation is great, we get on the train with the child once again, trouble switches there, We're three hours away from Moscow, and, in general, I understand that every second counts, let alone minutes, and like this, well, the ambulance can't drive anywhere, because there's a forest and a fence on both sides like this. I'm just in a panic, the child has convulsions there, loss of consciousness and so on, and I was already going there from the helicopter. Well, in short, I've been through these three hours, too, just like that. This has already happened recently. This is no longer on the healthy psyche when this was the beginning, and this is already now, when I have already ... already everything. And so, thank God, everything is fine, I get to the hospital in Moscow. And I had, as I thought, two of the closest friends in Moscow. And so I called both of them, and none of them came.
Speaker B: Did you ask?
Speaker A: Well, it seemed to me somehow... Well, it goes without saying. I have one girlfriend there at the dacha with the children, it's kind of a long way to go there. The second is that I have a child in intensive care, I'm just, well, dead inside myself. And I have a second child, well, I have twins. And the second child is with me, and I need to behave adequately in front of her somehow. That's it. And I just died. So I'm calling one person, I'll talk, if I can, I'll come. And neither one nor the other arrived. The second was very upset that he was going on vacation, he was not allowed. I told my story, I say, I hope that you will calm down a little now. I went on vacation, but I do not know how I would get to the point with one child or two. Well, apparently, he thought there, oh, thank God, I don't have such a situation, and that's it. That's all. And no one came to support me, although they were nearby. Here, probably, life experience tells me that everyone doesn't care about each other, it didn't cost anything at all.
Speaker B: It seems important to me that you are theirs.
Speaker A: This was not requested. It is necessary to ask.
Speaker B: Well, how else?
Speaker A: Well, it seems to me that if there is no difficult answer for a person, it is clear thatï¿½ Well, especially since it's not just that I have something sad there, yes, it's a very, well, such a serious situation. What would you do? Would you wait until you were asked to come? Or how? Here's your friend calling, saying I have a child in intensive care. I'm sitting under the doors there now, searching, and I don't even know if he's alive or not. And you would probably sit and wait. Well, will they ask me to come or won't they come? They won't ask. If they don't ask, I won't come. So?
Speaker B: It would be important for me to be asked about this, if you are asking about me. It seems to me that... You look at it from your side, you see this situation as something that people don't want to help you, but there may be different thoughts in your head. A person may not know how to behave, not know if he can come to you in the sense of how much you need it, how much you would like it. You explain it to yourself unequivocally, but I think that the palette of options can be wider.
Speaker A: If they are at a loss, they don't know, then you can ask. If you want, I'll come, I'll support you. Well, in this case, as it were, the injured party, let's say, is me. And at that moment, well, I can't think straight at all, let's say, and not to think. Well, I'm in grief, right? At this moment, you generally have a brain there, well, everything inside you is dying. And at this moment there to think. about another person, what could he think there, but how to tell him the right thing there, it's impossible at all. Indeed, it is impossible. I can 't at this time I am .
Speaker B: I just see some trend. You started by saying that, in general, I told you about it, that you feel isolated, that you feel abandoned and as if everyone turned away from you. And I automatically start thinking about how it happens, how it happens that you find yourself in this place every time? It's hard to assume that the whole world is unfair to you. Or the whole world treats you somehow badly.
Speaker A: I'm not saying that I'm being treated badly or unfairly. I never thought I needed it.
Speaker B: All your examples, they are about the fact that you need help. Do you need someone to share with you, help you, support you?
Speaker A: I want to do it myself, but I don't know how. That's how I told you, it's easier for me, well, it's easier for me to cope on my own than to explain something to someone there. Well, it's difficult for me. A lot of effort is spent on this. And still the person will not really understand. Well, it's easier for me myself. So I want to deal with this problem myself. And you say it's impossible.
Speaker B: I'm just thinking how I could help you if you want to cope on your own, you want others to somehow understand what you need and offer it yourself. I'm thinking, somehow, where, so that this can be done, how could I help you if you don't want help, if you want to cope yourself.
Speaker A: Give some advice on how to do it myself. Exactly. As a psychologist. Psychological.
Speaker B: How can I give you advice on how to handle yourself?
Speaker A: Yes. There is no such advice.
Speaker B: I do not know such advice. I'm sorry that you are so distancing yourself from the world. I'm sorry that in this case you don't give a hand to you.
Speaker A: I don't refuse to help. I just don't ask for it myself.
Speaker B: Well, yes. And this is such a clear contradiction. You do not refuse help, and you will not abandon it.
Speaker A: No, I can accept it. But ask me... Well, as it were... You don't have to quit. Can a person just come and give? I will gratefully accept. But go and ask... Let's get it straight.
Speaker B: We live in an adult world of adults. No one here can read other people's thoughts. Well, that's a fact. This is a given. No one should, should, or can read your thoughts and know your needs. And this, of course, is some kind of very understandable position not to ask and be offended by people for not giving you something.
Speaker A: Yes, I'm not offended. Yes, I understand that everyone lives their own life. And, well, no, there is no offense at all. That's the truth. I understand that I have a lot of children there and what kind of dacha there is. Why spoil your mood?
Speaker B: How would your request sound then, if we proceed from the assumption that I can't give you advice? About how you can cope on your own.
Speaker A: You gave it to me already. I realized that the only way to get rid of the pain is to share it with someone.
Speaker B: You don't like this advice.
Speaker A: Like, dislike. If there is no other way out, there is no other way, we must follow this path.
Speaker B: How do you feel now?
Speaker A: How do you feel right now? I have a way. That's it, that's serious, I'm even in any new problem, yes, that arises, here's some new diagonal being put, yes, it's always here you don't know anything, some kind of uncertainty, you don't know where to run, and this is the worst period. Then you read something there, you heard a lot of advice there from a bunch of doctors, and you chose this path, and it gets right to you that you know where to go, finally. And now, probably, about the same thing.
Speaker B: And if I assume that you feel disappointed?
Speaker A: No, not at all. I know where to go. Even if I don't like this way, I know where to go, what to do.
Speaker B: This is already... And where do you want to go?
Speaker A: That's what I need to work out. Action plan. Share your pain. Well, I think the first step is to see a psychologist. Probably, this is the fastest, fastest way. The most productive yet. Well, more... You can also rehabilitate friends. In short, I will connect everyone.
Speaker B: Well, you're sitting with a psychologist right now.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: And right now you can start doing something.
Speaker A: Well, I've already shared the pain with you. What else should I start doing?
Speaker B: I don't know. I see that on the one hand you have moist eyes, on the other hand you smile and exude a very big positive.
Speaker A: Listen, that's really it. Wet eyes are already... Well this... I've been crying here. I've probably been crying for an hour. They're going to dry out now. No, actually... listen, straight... When I came here, I didn't think it was... How to say? Since I have a lot of tasks, I want to do everything most productively so that every step I take brings some kind of result. I'm on some emotions... Something was very hard there too. I decided to come, but at the last moment I think I'm just wasting my time. It really seemed that way. You see, I'm talking about mine, I need to spend it rationally, otherwise I won't cope with everyone. You see, I also think only of myself. Here, by the way, is the answer to your question, why I think everyone thinks only about themselves. Because I'm loaded with a bunch of problems, and now strangers probably just won't fit if someone is there in my life, yes, because I have my own like this. Probably me, that's why I think so of others. That was a digression. So, and about the fact that I was walking and thought that I would waste my time in vain.
Speaker B: I understood correctly that you don't have any inner strength and space to empathize with someone, and it seems to you that the people around them also don't have space or time.
Speaker A: Yes. So, my same thought that I have now realized that I have just spent this time very productively.
Speaker B: We still have 13 minutes.
Speaker A: I have a way. Path. I saw a path to follow. Thank you so much for that. We still have time. Yes? Can I remember something else that bothers me? No, in fact, this is the only important thing, because when I find the strength, that is, if I get rid of this pain, on which a lot of resources are spent, there will be a lot of energy for everything else, I will certainly cope with the rest. I've talked a lot, but you haven't. A lot, right?
Speaker B: You sound like the meeting is over for you. It's been like this for 7-8 minutes.
Speaker A: And I'm because I'm already... not finished for myself? Well, I have a way. Here the problem is almost solved, let's say. And.
Speaker B: Where will you go next in this way?
Speaker A: Well, that's how I told you. Psychologist. Friends. Let them listen, share my grief.
Speaker B: And how do you take care of yourself? How do you help yourself to cope with all this?
Speaker A: Nothing. Now I'm only taking care of the children. Well, really, I don't even have a minute to think at all. You know, I'm like a biorobot, which, of course, I feel nothing, but I mean, it doesn't feel anything, it only performs some functions.
Speaker B: This hell of having children, how is your life?
Speaker A: Oh, great. I generally lived for my own pleasure, traveled a lot, worked a lot, but also traveled a lot, entertained myself a lot. Even my mom, when she called, asked how I was doing, she said, well, you're not bored there. Well, as if this is the main question, yes, such that I was, sorry, good, fun, was in a good mood. That's how I would live.
Speaker B: And how do you feel about this situation in general? To the fact that six years ago your wonderful life changed dramatically.
Speaker A: How is it in general? If everything could be repeated, I would repeat it. Well, because children are, well, they have such a return from them that None. It used to seem to me that traveling is such a thrill when you come to a new country, especially some exotic countries, just wow. And now I understand that wow is the coolest kids in the world. So how do I feel? I feel good about it. This is my path, my tasks, life sets before me, I have to solve them.
Speaker B: Something like this. Is there any regret?
Speaker A: Not a drop at all. No. But I'm coping. I don't have two wheelchairs, you know? I'm coping. I think I'm doing just fine. Well, except for what's going on inside, if you don't take it. But that's how it would be. The outside side is I'm good.
Speaker B: Well, there is no doubt in my mind that you are doing well.
Speaker A: Seriously, I didn't make mistakes. Now I will tell you another situation. One woman shared. Her daughter had miningitis. And it looks like, yes, when we were brought to the hospital, I immediately allowed the child to take a puncture from the spinal cord, from the podvonochnik. His legs gave out after that. And I was just like, oh my God, one wrong step, everything, your life is changing, well, I don't know where, already from Honduras, where is it further, right? So, and one woman just said, no, don't take this puncture. Four hours passed, the child's condition worsened. And during this time, the child just went deaf, yes. And here I am every time, every moment, right here, just not to make a mistake, just not to make a mistake, right now to make the right decision. And thank God, during this time, well, as it seems to me, at the moment I have not made these serious mistakes. Well, in general, so far everything is fine. I even went into the bathroom at that moment on time, you know? This, well...
Speaker B: I would like to ask again, how do you take care of yourself?
Speaker A: Nothing.
Speaker B: So you're such a superman all the time?
Speaker A: I am all the time, yes. Well, no, not Superman, this is my usual life. It's just that I, as it were, all my thoughts and actions are aimed at solving these tasks that are related to children. Yes, I work to earn money for all these massage therapists, speech pathologists, rehabilitologists and so on. Just for that. Well, as if everything I do is to fix this situation so that we get out of it with the least losses. How are you? I'm fine. I have a path. Have you nothing to say?
Speaker B: Well, yes. You are making an impression to the person at the moment. A person who doesn't need help. And support is not needed. I'm trying to find some place where I can support you. You talk so confidently about how well you are doing and how you are coping with everything that I don't see a place for this.
Speaker A: And you see how with one phrase you oop me, and guided me to the right path. No, I understand that there is still a lot of work ahead on this, but... In short, there was hope that... And this issue can be solved.
Speaker B: We still have about seven minutes. What'll we do?
Speaker A: What are we going to do? Tell jokes. About seven minutes. Here's what else can we discuss? How do I learn to ask for help? As we also touched on this issue, I'm not voicing, I'm not asking, come support. Now I realized that it's difficult for me, it doesn't even occur to me.
Speaker B: I think something similar is happening right now. You are not asking for help right now and are talking about how you don't need it and how you are coping on your own. Perhaps this may be the answer to why this is happening right now.
Speaker A: So, I don't understand now. You asked... The answer? So I asked you for advice now, yes, how do I learn to ask for help. I won't sew it, yes, I know that I don't ask for it, even when I need it. Well, just by an effort of will to take and ask, yes, or... What I could be wearing right now.
Speaker B: Maybe you need help? Right at the moment.
Speaker A: Well, give me this advice on how to overcome yourself, yes, or how to learn to ask for help.
Speaker B: So I'm trying to figure out right now what you need? Right now, what can help consist of?
Speaker A: That's in this skill. Well, I have to keep working, right? And why would you?
Speaker B: Why would you ask for help? You're talking about a certain skill, but so far I don't really understand what need you want to satisfy with this.
Speaker A: Well, right now, I probably don't need it. But I also know that I will never have a situation in my life when I need it. It is necessary to speak directly for a specific situation.
Speaker B: The only thing we can do is work with something that is happening at the moment. We cannot fantasize about what we should do in some potentially possible future, in potentially possible circumstances.
Speaker A: Well, in general, I realized that when you need this support, you just have to talk about it. come and support your friends. Just saying it. Well, in general it is clear. Well, really, it's just that in those situations there in general, instead of brains, you just have an atomic explosion and that's it. It is very difficult to reason.
Speaker B: Are there any other questions?
Speaker A: No, everything else is solvable, I think. Are we done then? What question? If, for example, we continue with you Here is the question. If I realized that I need to continue working with a psychologist... I'm just here now... When you are already switching to practical... Practically how will this happen? That is, the task is to share my pain.
Speaker B: This is if you want someone to share it with you.
Speaker A: Yes. And it's just going to be a conversation in what format. Now I can't really formulate a thought. I'm just telling you some of these situations that I really like... I don't know, it depends.
Speaker B: From the specialist you will go to.
Speaker A: Well, here to you, for example.
Speaker B: I can't say what will happen next if we suddenly work ourselves. Because it's a living process. There is no clear step-by-step structure in it. You need to learn to listen to yourself, tell your loved ones. It doesn't work that way a little bit. A little less linear. So I'm afraid I can't answer. I see. Then we're done.
Speaker A: Well then that's it.
Speaker B: It is difficult to support a person when he does not really know how to receive this support. There is no skill. This is not a condemnation in any way. There is no skill of getting support. There is a desire to receive help and support. there is no developed internal tool. And in this session, I tried to express this support tool somehow, to be the one who supervises and shares what is happening with the client. in the first half of the consultation, it seems to me that it worked out. It so happens that inside we have very strong contradictions between what we want and what we can do. Let's say we want someone to love us, but we don't really know how to accept love. Or do we want someone to empathize with us, and being close to someone who empathizes with us does not work well. And in this case, this consultation for me was exactly about this, that I had the impression that this client really needed support, empathy and sharing his own feelings, especially since such a strong person, in fact, experienced very traumatic events. and continues to be in them. That is, a person had a life before and has a life after. And this life after is radically different from the life before. In general, in simple terms, I tried to be close. In this consultation, I tried to be close, to empathize, to show empathy. The client feels very isolated, separate from people, separate from the world. And, probably, this is what the family system has taught this client. And the client has grown up and feels separate from the world, that something is wrong with him. and the world is somehow hostile or neutral to this. This is the first story. The second story is that really, when you have serious problems in your family, when you are absorbed in them and it takes up a significant part of your life, it is really difficult for you to communicate with the world, because there is a feeling that the whole world around you is happy, And somehow the sun is there, the birds are singing, and that's all you have it's bad and nobody needs it to hell. The best thing you can try to do is to show that you are not indifferent to a person's problems. that what he feels and what is happening to him is not something extraordinary, and everything is fine with it, and feelings are understandable, and feelings are explicable, and there is nothing terrible to be strong next to these feelings. That is, if this client and I would have met further, I would have done everything to stay in touch and somehow talk about feelings and make it clear that you can be very close to this. And the client asked a lot about the fact that some specific steps are needed, some specific advice is needed to find, unfortunately. The advice does not work very well, because the client came with strong feelings, with grief, with tears. And this is the level of feelings. And sometimes there is a feeling that you need to do something practical with your problem. That is, it doesn't work that way. That is, if you have a pain inside, then you need to do something with what you have inside. Unfortunately, it's probably worth ending with this, which, unfortunately, in adulthood, and we all, or most of those who watch it, are adults, no one can do something for us. The only thing that others can do, and a psychologist, and close people, is to share our feelings. That is, no one can live our life for us. No one can take us, pull us out of something bad and put us in something good. The only thing that a person nearby can do if we feel bad, if we are inside in some kind of hell, is to stay close and hold our hand so that this hell becomes a little lighter, so that the clouds disperse. No one can come and save us, no matter how much we want to.
