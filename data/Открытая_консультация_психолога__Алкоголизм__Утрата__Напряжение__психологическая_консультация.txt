Speaker B: Yes, I will. In fact, there was an event recently, a wedding, literally on the 25th at our closest and dearest, and I was preparing for this wedding for a very long time, because it was just such a moment when my children had already moved away from my chest, for example, well, that is, when you can completely relax, even though they were still with us, but this one I was preparing very much for this day, there are outfits, there is everything-everything-everything. And this very day comes, and I, as I say, have a speech coma. I mean, I don't talk, I'm not in the mood. Well, this is due to the fact, that's just why I decided to work it out after all. My mother died at the age of 14. So, my dad and I sort of were. I myself come from the North Caucasus, there is a city like Georgievsk, I'm from there. And now I live in the Republic of Belarus. Here, in general, and my dad for today's time, he's like an alcoholic homeless, but so far he still has a house. in which he lives, but he lives in terrible, just terrible circumstances, in these conditions, let's say. Well, here's the wedding. The first thing that upsets me to tears there is when the Bride is handed over, there is a mother with candles, and these are all tears. But this time the bride upset me. My father dedicated the song, he is a musician himself and sings very well, and the song was there, there is "Hallelujah", and in this song there were such beautiful words that "I will be there to watch your cats." and that I am proud of you, such beautiful words, and I was covered, well, that is, right in general, and I realized that there is still a lot of pain in me, although I live more without my mother than I lived with her, because she died when I was 14, and without I already live with her 18. Here, but about mom, it's probably somehow more or less clear. But about my father, well, it turns out that I have such, well, pain inside. And I sort of defined this state, feeling, as feeling there is a lot of pain in me. This one here, maybe not experienced, maybe not lived, maybe not accepted. I just can't figure it out myself yet. The only thing I realized was that it wasn't a grudge. Well, how would I, well, I, for example, We dad, I still have a sister, we tried to move him to the republic here, to us, to Belarus, when he was still at the third stage, roughly speaking. But he's not there, where I'm going, I'm cool here, I'm fine here, I'm going to live here, everything's fine. Then, so that you understand, he had debt obligations, he took out a loan for which he did not pay. This is the whole story, which, in principle, transferred him to where he is now. In principle, there is nothing so adequate left here. To tell me that I'm really worried about it there, for him, well, no, why, well, damn, it's his choice, it's his life, well, that's how he is with her, as it were, when mom just died, as I say, everything that surrounded her died, you know, when she dies a person is dying of the space that he once created and filled.
Speaker A: And Mom created some kind of home space all.
Speaker B: Somehow I looked after everyone, somehow I settled it all, then she died and that's how I would be here, in principle, as if my sister was already in Belarus at that time, she was pregnant and well, as if her husband had just appeared, so somehow it's there so. And I was thinking about this pain, oh my God, really? Well, that was so much for me, well, that's tearful. Well, I cried, although I am such a, well, rarely a crying person in fact. So, I thought, well, now, really, I say, I feel kind of bad here. Is it hard, has it become? Well, somehow it doesn't feel very good here.
Speaker A: Can I slow down a little bit in this place? And what's not so good here?
Speaker B: What exactly? Now it has become difficult here. That's exactly where the collarbone is, not the collarbone, but the sternum, that's exactly such a kind of heaviness and as if... it was as if something had shrunk.
Speaker A: And what did it shrink about? What of what you're saying has it shrunk?
Speaker B: Probably, everything has something to do with dad and mom, with parents, you know, somehow with them. Well, somehow with them. I sort of had a very complicated and difficult life afterwards, respectively, but it's all gone, and I'm kind of fine now. I have a husband, two children, and a job, and a hobby that has outgrown, turned into my work. Well, that is, as it were, but that's how if you touch your parents, well, somehow you want to cry all the time. Well, that is, somehow, somehow here. such is the story, especially about Dad somehow, well, I do not know. I realized at some point in time that I had read Liz Bourbeau's book "Five Traumas and the Healing of Five Traumas", and there was a trauma there, and I realized in this book that, well, I somehow resented him, I thought he should pay more attention to me because Well, I was very small then, well, how would he I don't even know how to say how he treated, well, like some, I don't know, some friend, or something, well, to me, yes. Well, we have such, like, we had such... It was his idea. He worked for a day and two at home. And when he worked for a day, he told me, the apartment is yours. Well, like, he set up such a relationship with us. that I'm not bothering you, and you're not bothering me. Well, when you need an apartment, please, and when I need it, he could call me and say don't come home today. Well, that is, yes, to go to my grandmother, to go to my grandfather, as if, well, everything is fine there, there too, as if there was a lot of love for me, that's it. And so I somehow resented him, and then I realized that he was not to blame for anything in front of me. He kind of behaved towards me as best he could, given the fact that he was also left without a mom, and he also somehow became alone. one here is the apartment here is the need to earn this here is this and here I am and what to do about it there are some other grievances against my mother there are incomprehensible and here he is with all this, as if he could not cope with it, he never paid for the apartment, we had endless debts all the time, just incredible for which my grandfather paid, by the way, his father probably even they, too, unfortunately, have all died, it's good that they don't see him in this state, because they wouldn't have endured. It's hard to watch when he lives in such conditions.
Speaker A: And how do you feel looking at him in such conditions? More precisely, do you feel something else?
Speaker B: Horror. The horror of that... Not even on how it's possible. I understand that he is where he brought himself. He did everything to be where he is now. More precisely, he didn't do anything. He has a very bad sense of responsibility. And I was even ready, my sister, she's older, she's like, yeah, well, even to me, like no, he won't live with us. Well, she's like, and I, no, I need to move my dad, I need to go with my dad and I need this. But he didn't agree, he didn't agree. Probably, even someone said that well, you, well, you don't need him, well, you don't need to transport him. This is a bad story, because, well, he won't give life later just because he is such a person. Here. And I probably haven't talked to anyone about it. Maybe that's also why it's hard here. It's like, you know, the pioneers are kind of breaking through a tunnel here. And somehow it's difficult for me here. Here.
Speaker A: Can I ask you to take a couple of deep breaths now?
Speaker B: Oh, yes.
Speaker A: And one more thing. Thank you. And what would you like to see as a result of our meeting?
Speaker B: I also thought about this question. As a result of this meeting, I would probably like to understand, for myself, first of all, is it normal to assume that he lives in such conditions, as it were, in such conditions he is likely to die there alone. well, whatever it was, it will soon overtake him because well, everything is completely safe there, he smokes and sleeps, and when I came to visit him, he had burnt-out mattresses, well, that's all he had and what I would like to see the result of our meeting, Well, probably, as if a small help here in this re-life, or something. Well, so that I, well, don't cry like that, so when there is some kind of here, it turns out that there was an incentive, and I just got blocked. Such a day, such an event, you need to rejoice, you need to have fun, and I'm sitting here, I was leaving everyone, sitting in the distance, watching what was happening, but I don't interact with anyone. Well, it happens to me, I say that's it, I'm silent. I can also send it if they start digging in. Well, somehow, I guess that's what I see.
Speaker A: You said that you would like to understand if this is normal. I want to rephrase a little. You tell me if I'm right or wrong. When you ask if this is normal, do you mean how do you not feel Guilty? Or responsible?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: What does it mean?
Speaker B: Well, is it normal that I don't worry too much about the fact that he is in such conditions. I mean, well, I'm like, well, well, damn, well, that's how he lives, well, that's it.
Speaker A: For me there is a certain dissonance in this. You're talking about whether it's okay not to worry about it. On the other hand, you begin your story with a story about how you were overwhelmed with feelings about it at the wedding, including, and could not talk to anyone. So are you worried or not worried about it?
Speaker B: Well, I'm worried exactly that there's probably some kind of feeling that I probably have since my father was not. he's like a father, it's a shame to me for that, well, that is, I didn't have a father as such, well, that's right, so that's right, I just look at how my husband communicates with children, what kind of grandfather I had, yes, well, dad, well, it's just that, is that- something with something, well, here he has two of us, me and my sister, well, there, well, not her, well, he just didn't take place as a father, here he is to me, well, it probably hurts me for that.
Speaker A: Is it a shame?
Speaker B: Well, probably that... Yes, yes, it's probably a shame.
Speaker A: And before Mom left, was he? Well, I mean, was Dad a dad somehow?
Speaker B: Well, no, I wasn't. That mom was on the other hand. My mother was always and everywhere, I was my mother's child, because already at my age there began some discos, some hangouts there. Oh, no, I'm with my mom, I'm there for the city holiday, I'm with my mom. I went to work with her after school, now that I remember, I just wouldn't let her pass, well, honestly. Well, that is, I always somehow found her everywhere and was next to her, well, that is, I really didn't give her a pass. And Dad, well, Dad came there in the evening at his place, when he had a drink, his eyebrows always gave him away. They somehow became a house for him and it was visible. Well, that is, there you leave the room, dad came, you look, eyebrows like a house, everything is useless, well, because well, he asks the same questions, he does not listen to you, he interrupts, he is not interested in anything. Well, you look at him in such a good state, you think, well, that's it, well, there's nothing to talk about. That's why no. He probably wasn't there. No, it wasn't. Grandfather was. Here's Grandpa there, as I call him, the house of Corleone. He was a very wise, intelligent and kind person.
Speaker A: Grandpa is Daddy's dad.
Speaker B: Yes, yes, Daddy's dad. Yes. And our grandfather was like that. Well, we all loved him.
Speaker A: And how did Mom leave? Why did she leave?
Speaker B: Mom left when she was 41.
Speaker A: Well, yes, I think she was young.
Speaker B: Absolutely! I look at 41-year-old women now and think, my God, at what an early age she finally left. At 41, she left, and she burned down with carbon monoxide. We buried her beautiful.
Speaker A: And how did it happen?
Speaker B: Well, I won't tell you the details, if I may, but that's exactly what, well, an accident, let's say an accident.
Speaker A: Does it have something to do with everything?
Speaker B: No, no, no. Dad was at work for days, I was home alone, she didn't come home, I was looking for her all night and found her in the morning. Well, they already called me, said that, well, like everything, Mom died. And, well, that's it. And she's gone.
Speaker A: I would like to say that I am very sorry for you.
Speaker B: Well, yes, damn, there is something to sympathize with. Yes, well, the story is sad, because, well, in principle, when children are left without parents, it's sad. And the child is very sorry. He's, well, so lost, no one needs him, in principle.
Speaker A: Baby, is that how you talk about yourself in the third person?
Speaker B: Well, I look at my children and think, God, God, well, it would be bad, it would be bad for the child when there is no mom. Well, because she's like everything. And my mom was very good. Well, as if there were never any questions to her at all. Kind, beautiful, cheerful, affectionate. Every morning buzzy, kisses, at night the same thing. And Dad woke me up, he shouted from the room, Nastya, wake up. Well, there is no, you know, this impudence in him. And we had a big apartment, he kept shouting at me to wake up, to go to school. And here are the cases too. Here's the graduation, for example, I had in the ninth grade, I graduated with a red diploma. I was already working then. I actually went to work very early. And he told me, what are you at home, what are you not at work? I say, I have a graduation today, they give me a diploma, they help me out. He's like that, yes, but I'll come. I say don't come. I say, you're not in good condition, he's already drunk too. Well, Grandpa came. Grandfather came to us, to the diploma, when I was given.
Speaker A: How did they coexist with us?
Speaker B: Well, they had passion, love in general, they had everything, well, everything seemed to be fine. Sometimes they swore, well, and then because he stayed there somewhere, then he came tipsy, there were scandals corresponding to this. Well, everywhere together, everywhere they hugged endlessly, well, I'm telling you, the passion was boiling right now, even though they've been together for a long time, I mean, well, no, something like they have. He was running around there all the time, saying I loved her, she said she loved him, that's it. So he also said that he met her somewhere in the Caucasus, saw her, he saw her, said that he was dead. That's it, I went there to Belarus, moved her home. Well, here, there, to the Caucasus. She is in Belarus herself. Well, that's the kind of love they had. There was love, there was. Well, such, I remember that it's straight normal. Here.
Speaker A: I would like to check your request again. It's not entirely clear to me which way.
Speaker B: How not to cry at a wedding? How not to cry at events, at those where there is a mom and dad? Well, that's where they are there, that's all there for the children, for their own, just our children, our pride is there, and they carry candles, and sing songs, and so what do you think? And my dad is an alcoholic. How, probably, how to remove this pain? And this is not the first wedding for some. I cry about my mom at all weddings. This is probably normal. This time my dad upset me, it was when he congratulated his daughter-fiancee dad.
Speaker A: I don't quite understand, but what's wrong with crying about your parents at a wedding?
Speaker B: Well, yes, nothing bad, really. Well, no, there's nothing wrong. Many people actually cried. For some reason, I have a speech coma. And that's exactly what I have... Well, I'm like... like this one... like pain. For some reason, it was very painful for me. Well, here I am... I wanted to say, there's so much pain in me. That's what I remembered for some reason. That's so much pain in me. It turns out that so much pain lives in me. I thought I had gone through it all, I forgot. and it turns out that so much pain lives in me. And I was thinking, you know what else, that maybe I haven't relived it yet. It happens, you know, that I haven't cried, I haven't lived through it. That is, this is the story with my mother, they didn't let me cry much there, because my tears upset my grandmother. then dad's sister, aunt, Nastya is already there for me, well, please, don't cry like that, grandma then drinks there, well, these, well, mom, mom is, aunt, yes, everything is from dad's side, here, and maybe that's my mom somehow, maybe that's all already, you know, I say that a lot of time has passed, and with dad it's just, most likely, probably, with dad it's a new story now, well, the fact that he's already right at the bottom, this has not happened yet and now he's come to this and maybe it's something new that you need relive probably like this, that's how I now drew thanks to your question.
Speaker A: It seems to me that the difficulty in the situation with dad is that the event has not yet happened what exactly, well, something bad, I mean. Well, for me in many ways what you say, it sounds exactly about that. That you understand what is going to happen. Well, that in one form or another you see your father slowly leaving. Well, this is such a very, very difficult knowledge for a child, his parent.
Speaker B: Well, yes, it is also possible. This is a good, as it is, interpretation.
Speaker A: What do you usually do with your complicated feelings? A very vague question. I'll explain, I see what's there at our meeting with you, leaving out the context of the fact that this is the first meeting and that we are recording you, but I see how you are, well, somehow smiling, how cheerful you are, how you somehow hold yourself. I don't think it's on purpose somehow, well, it's just more like a marker for me, a marker of how you can, and you talk about very difficult things, while some cheerfulness and a smile do not leave your face. And at this point, the question arises, how much is this characteristic of you at all. Because my hypothesis is that what rather surprised or scared you, maybe not that you met with feelings about your father, but that you met with very strong feelings.
Speaker B: Whom I didn't expect to meet.
Speaker A: Well, yes.
Speaker B: Well, maybe there's something to it. About smiling and all that, well, like, yes, some kind... Well, to be sad, I probably don't know how. Although I can, but I was sad at the wedding. They approached everyone there and asked what was wrong with Nastya, because it was completely unusual for them to see me in such a state. Well, something like that. And I was very bright, well, I was bright, that's how I was going to be, we were very bright, and here I am not talking to anyone, sad, well, that's exactly what. Well, about that, well, yes, listen, it's in general. You are certainly powerful. This is a very good question. Probably, probably, there is something in this. that I seem to be starting to be sad in advance, well, you even know how, probably, I have nothing to be happy about here in the context of how my father lives, yes, here, and in principle I already want to be sad because of this, well, you can be sad because of this, and then you probably understand that it's your father. Well, your father. And... and, probably, somehow yes. And, probably, somehow sad. I loved him very much, by the way. Well, I just remember right strongly. And then... Then he began to do everything to make these feelings become less and less. He did such things quite ugly. And then I went to Belarus, and we rarely communicate at all. That is, he never congratulates anyone, on any holidays. I'm silent there about some gifts, which, in principle, did not even exist when I had a birthday, when we lived next door. Here.
Speaker A: Do you communicate in any way now?
Speaker B: Well, very rarely. My sister flew to the Caucasus. We always usually fly there once a year to visit his aunt, his sister. Well, plus Mom is buried there with us. Here she is buried there. And we fly there once a year. And so we come to visit him. And every year it gets lower, lower and lower. Worse, worse and worse. Here, well, we'll sit there a little bit, about what, well, you know, he can't even ask normal questions, well, he's like, well, he already has such a brain that, well, he brings children to him, well, it would seem that grandfather, that's right, well, somehow he in general, they are completely, well, hello Lida, hello there and I, as it were, everything. Calmly somehow. Well, I'm not talking about any of these gifts at all. They never existed, even when he was still normal. Here. Well, in connection with all this, something like that there. It was his birthday on September 5th. I didn't even remember. Then my sister tells me that you congratulated Dad. I say no, well, that is, I'm still on maternity leave, maybe, well, of course this is an excuse, but as if there is no such tracking of numbers specifically, that is, I can track what day of the week it is, and what number it is today, in principle, it doesn't matter in the decree, well, somehow here is such a love relationship as such, there is some kind of care, there is no care for him, well, that's how it is.
Speaker A: I may be asking in a strange way now, but I will ask. And how does it feel for you on maternity leave?
Speaker B: Oh, it was really bad recently. Actually, it was literally just the same August. But it's getting better now. Well, in September, Lida went to school with me. I'm taking Ilya to the garden for adaptation now. And I myself came out as a part-time psychologist-teacher. I'm at school, I have an education. And I was finishing... Well, I also have various certificates. I graduated from the Academy of Sense. Kurpatov has one, you know, Andrei Vladimirovich. And here I am... and now I come to study, well, I went to school, now somehow, the kids are busy, but they don't nurse me like that anymore, so it got a little better. And before that it was somehow like that, yes, not really. But this is the last one.
Speaker A: You have been on maternity leave for many years, it turns out?
Speaker B: Well, 6 years, it turns out, yes, 6 years Lida, then Ilyukha, but Ilyukha is for two of me. That is, Ilyukha put an end to the procreation of our family. Because he's a boy-a light like that, a rocket. He was yelling all the time before the water, because all his teeth had come out, and here he was, poor, shouting all year, both at night and during the day. Well, and so I gave the heat generally normal. If Lida is a calm girl, then Ilyusha is, of course, a boy-light. But very gentle, by the way. A very, very gentle boy. that you won't tell the truth, for example. Well, something like that. But I have a good husband, I want to celebrate it very much, because.
Speaker A: What is he... Because he's going to watch this video.
Speaker B: And there, yes, a piggy bank. Well, he, you know, what is in him, he sees what is valuable and important to me, and he does it. And he somehow does it, and it's straight in general, right touches to the depths of the soul, you think, And I also want to do something like that. But he has such a feature. Somehow he notices it all. But it makes me happy all the time. I was very lucky with my husband. Well, you know what, I just thought that this is the question with parents, how, probably, how to take it more calmly that they just don't exist in principle. Well, here they are, they seem to have been and not, but about dad again, you see, in the past, yes, I say, but he has not been in my life as such for a long time, yes, a person.
Speaker A: But at the same time it is there. It seems to me that it is harder than when there is no.
Speaker B: Well, yes, but at the same time it is, yes. At the same time, it is.
Speaker A: Looking ahead and answering your question about how not to worry about it there, I don't think you can not worry about it. Well, that is, from time to time you can and you meet with some situations that stimulate your internal processes, and your feelings rise outwards. It seems to me that this is very human.
Speaker B: Well, yes, that's also true. It became easier to breathe. Yes, well, I just took a breath now, and nothing pulled me down here. And so it pulled. Pulled a little. Well, in general, I realized that if it's already so short, as it were, to feedback about this, that, in principle, a feeling of pain and a feeling of some kind of grief and sadness about parents, especially if one of them is gone, then I know, in principle, it's like normal, but normal, that is, normal to cry for a person who was infinitely and infinitely dear to you, yes, you can probably still cry about your mother, in fact, even though so much time has passed. memories as such also dissipate. And as for Dad, well, yes, it's probably just too rough here, there's also something to be sad about, let's say, not without it, it's also just necessary to, well, understand it and accept it. Well, okay, yes. Probably something like that, if you already give feedback specifically on this request.
Speaker A: Well, we still have enough time.
Speaker B: I wanted to know something else to tell you that I don't know how to rest. Well, this is also some kind of abnormal story. Well, that is, I'm like this toy that gets started in the morning. How is your youngest?
Speaker A: Like Ilyukha, probably.
Speaker B: Probably. That's it, I've been running around all day and now, well, it seems like right now I'm putting him to bed and going, well, yes, too, you can, you can, with him already here is Lida on extension, Kostya, well, my husband left for Moscow, he works for me in Moscow. She'll sleep with him, too. I'm there, I have there, I have to have or training, I train every other day. Either I'm ironing, or I'm doing something around the house, or I'm there... Well, that is, I am all the time... Well, I have it... I don't know how to relax. That's right here at all. That is, I constantly, well, have to do something. And it's, well, like this... I can go to bed, well, of course, that's when I feel really bad, there, I have some kind of cold or poisoning, or something else. That's when I rest. I can lie there with selya, for example, yes? Or that's how they put these pins on me. This is generally a horror. But not about that. But I mean, back then I couldn't do anything, not study, nothing. It was so painful and bad for me. I don't know how to rest. How would it be related to what?
Speaker A: Well, if in general, it seems to me that your whole Life is directly connected with this.
Speaker B: So, how to relax? You are absolutely right. I started at some point. Then I had such a stage, I already moved here to Belarus. I moved here to Belarus, I immediately went back to work, went to enroll. That's all. And then I finished fitness. I worked as a manager, I sold granite monuments. And I did, retouched photos on the monument, too. And then I graduated in parallel fitness at school. I became a Pilates fitness instructor. And I'm here, so, on monuments, then on Pilates. And I was paying for a rental apartment. I moved out of my sister's. We lived well together for a long time, but we had to move out already. I paid for my studies, and I realized at some point that if I get sick now, then that's it, they won't pay me money, because I had such a payment. Well, that's it. And there will be no one to pay for this whole story, for school, for food, for... For everything, in short. That's just me later... I got married, actually, at 20... Probably at 28. No, well, I'm 34, and Kostya and I have been married for 7 years. Here we have the first marriage between him and me, we are childless, as if, well, we were before the meeting. Well, that is, I got married quite late, as it were. And all this time, yes, that was the story. Is it like learning to relax here? How to learn, well, how is it, to give yourself the opportunity to lie down? Or is it just necessary to take and lie down, but my brain will torment me right there?
Speaker A: I think the survival instinct is a very strong instinct.
Speaker B: Oh, you think? Yeah.
Speaker A: In order to stop surviving, you need to feel safe. The question is, do you feel safe?
Speaker B: Well, yes, I feel it. Well, as it is now, that's for sure. I can relax a little, well, that's exactly in the context. Earnings. Well, going to work for me, this is where a sip was needed and needed for me.
Speaker A: What happens to you when you relax?
Speaker B: I need to remember when it happened.
Speaker A: Here you say that if you don't do anything, then thoughts begin to swarm.
Speaker B: Well, why are you lying down, you would have worked out now, and the handles would have been stronger, and the legs would have been slimmer. And although there's nothing wrong with that. Then it's fed there, so you can bake something. Go bake something. You love it there, you can please Kostya. And over there the tile needs to be wiped, because the stains are visible. And I'm also not very well in terms of cleanliness. I scold everyone for littering everything. I need it to be clean. well, as if it were necessary and clean all the time. It's now that somehow I realized a little bit like this, that it's just a little bit there may be a toy lying around somewhere. Although my children seem to be developed in the sense that we don't use gadgets, we just play, read, go outside all the time, well, that is, I devote a lot of time to children. The only time I have is when I'm sleeping. This is my time, and so I dedicate it to myself. It's either training or training. Here. Or I'm watching you.
Speaker A: Thank you. Does it bother you? Is it the inability to relax?
Speaker B: Well, I somehow, you know, a friend came to me once, and she says that my husband and I went to the sauna there, took the sauna for two hours, and sat there for six. I say, Lord, what can you do for six hours in a sauna? She, well, we sprayed there, well, we're there, there it is, we're there. I'm thinking, but I need to do everything quickly. So we came, everyone was there, washed, steamed, clapped with money, gathered and ran on. Although that's all, it's time to go to bed. Well, that is, in principle, there... And if, God forbid, I have some plans there, and I don't have time to do something, then that's it. I'm completely out of it... Well, I'm starting to get very angry, angry. Well, I'm in control of it now, I now understand that it's okay, I explain it all to myself, I keep it more or less on myself. But I'm never late. This is unacceptable to me at all.
Speaker A: To someone... Once again, I'll ask the question again. Does it bother you?
Speaker B: Well, probably not. I couldn't have done it any other way. I probably would have done it differently, but I wouldn't be able to lie there knowing that I have a lot of things to do, for example, or knowing that I am... But on the other hand, well, yes, you asked the question correctly now, because when I feel bad, I lie down. And I'm lying right here. That is, when it hurts me, when I feel bad, I just don't do anything. Oh, yeah. No, it probably doesn't bother. Probably doesn't bother. No, it doesn't bother.
Speaker A: And your loved ones?
Speaker B: I don't know. Well, nobody told me anything about it.
Speaker A: Can they?
Speaker B: Well, I don't know. No, I can't answer that. No one said you were so actively infuriating. No.
Speaker A: Do you think they have such an opportunity? I mean, what would happen to them if they said they didn't like something?
Speaker B: I can't always stand up for myself, even now at this age, when there are some such attacks on my safety. Then I think, damn, why I have a sediment here, why it's unpleasant for me. I realized that because I didn't stand up for myself, I couldn't defend myself. Because of this, it's probably more unpleasant. I can't answer everyone. Not everyone at all. I have, by the way, with this... I need time to think, let's just say. Especially when if something is wrong, then I can't react right away. I need time to... Think about what to say. It would have to be said perfectly to no longer do that... Didn't take offense, or something. Well, as it sounds to me, as an Agita, sometimes.
Speaker A: If I understand correctly, then you do not suffer from the fact that you do not know how to relax. Your loved ones do not suffer from the fact that you do not know how to relax. Well, the issue can be considered resolved.
Speaker B: Yes. Regular. There are two questions. How lucky I got, yes. Two questions, yes. We decided. Maybe... I've been recording a little bit here. Well, I guess that's how it is, in principle, I wanted to rest. I don't know how to rest. Does it bother me? No, it doesn't bother. Here.
Speaker A: And then let me go back to the very beginning again and ask you why you came today. How would you answer this question, being at the very beginning of our meeting? Looking at the beginning of our meeting, did something lead you from this moment? For the first time in general, in an open meeting, right away. What did you want from this meeting?
Speaker B: I probably wanted to tell you that I had a difficult and difficult life, that my mother died. that it would be bad without her. And, probably, maybe... Well, now it's hard to say if it's bad now without her. Well, I guess I need it to some extent. It's just that few people want to hear it, and not many people can talk about it.
Speaker A: Later... Dad too... and you decided to tell it to several thousand people. How do you feel when you think that a lot of people will hear your story?
Speaker B: Nothing. I actually, well, somehow... By the way, here's what you just told me, I probably would like to talk more, like to talk to a psychologist, like to talk to you. It's just that you have the opportunity. So I took advantage of it. You gave it to me, I took it. I didn't expect that you would still, well, answer me usually when there are a lot of subscribers, there are few who answer. You also waited, you also adjusted, so for me it was, well, as if everything was very pleasant. Here. At least, well, here, yes, here, well, how would I probably answer. No? What do you think?
Speaker A: Well, I also have a feeling, yes, that it was important for you somehow to have someone witness your story.
Speaker B: Yes, to be heard, as it were, exactly, well, I wanted to tell you about it, I wanted to tell you about it. Well, probably not that everything is straight, well, it doesn't matter to me there, as it were, this is such a thing. It is you who are here. and you, as you and as a person who has provided such an opportunity, well, that I will look at a certain number of people there, well, as if I am not afraid of them, and people are actually like.
Speaker A: Do you feel right now when you, when this whole puzzle has formed and you have voiced your story, well, it's fine.
Speaker B: Now I'm smiling less, if you've noticed.
Speaker A: Of course.
Speaker B: Yes, well. That is, you see, it's probably some kind of mask, too, that was once dressed. You even have to think about when. Very interesting. How do I feel? Well, I won't say that I'm cheerful and cheerful. It's still sad. It's still sad that it's like this.
Speaker A: What is the sadness about now?
Speaker B: That there is no mother, there is no maternal support, there is no maternal care, there are no words "I am proud of you", although I have gone through so much, experienced so much. And what I want to say is that damn, you're so good, and I'm really so good, I've endured so much. I buried so many people, first my mother, then my grandmother, then my grandfather. And they were all not just social roles, they were all, they were really grandfather, really grandmother. They fully fulfilled all their tasks. They all loved me. I loved them very much. No one has ever offended, called names. And in general, then there was so much that I somehow went through it all. My children were born, I was nursing two breasts. This is a difficult stage, but those who breastfeed will understand. Then finish and here is breastfeeding. I did it eco-friendly, no one suffered. That is, I did it all slowly, smoothly, gradually, weaned. I'm like, well, everything is somehow competent, you know? And this is my fitness industry. I, well, here I am... Man, I believe I had no predisposition to any sports at all. And then everything turned out so cool for me, I had a lot of clients who signed up for a month, they could not buy season tickets. And I somehow brought something of my own into this Pilates, and it was wow. And when I was leaving already, that's it, I met Kostya. We have a wedding, then Lidochka. Lidochka, I got pregnant, and I was already leaving there. I didn't go back there anymore, it was in sports. Well, I'm at home studying on my own right now. Well, that is, it was straight, too, here is my brainchild, which I raised myself. Well, that is, I'm such a good fellow, but in fact I don't hear from anyone, probably that... Well, that's what I'm proud of. And, probably, here are the words of this song, yes, there were, here is "Hallelujah". The pride of being your father is just everything. Well, well, this is very deep. It's straight, well, to the core. And the pride of being your mother, well, too, well. I'll hear from Lida someday, I hope she's proud that I'm washing her. Well, from my mom, well, yes, she's proud of me, they tell me there that she's proud of you. Great, but it doesn't make me feel any better, yeah. Well, like that, well, probably, that's, well, like all the pain. How to hear the admiration from my parents.
Speaker A: Yes. It is a pity that the most necessary words are often never voiced in a lifetime.
Speaker B: Well, yes.
Speaker A: It turns out that it is. Nevertheless, I would like to say that you have something to be proud of, and you are really well done.
Speaker B: Да. Это да, это да. Гордусь ли я собой? Да, гордусь.
Speaker A: And we're running out of time.
Speaker B: Well, I understand everything.
Speaker A: We would like to... yes.
Speaker B: Well, I would like to say... I would like to express my great gratitude to you for being a good fellow in general. You run such a cool channel, and he... I'm very... I've watched so much, and so much... There are so many different fates of patients, well, just such heavy ones. And... and it's great that you are doing this. And about myself, what I wanted to say is that... Well, that a certain realization has come that, in principle, nothing like supernatural is happening, that it's normal to react in this way, that, well, I won't hear from my relatives, well, from mom, from dad, the word I'm proud of, so I'll hear from... Well, it's clear that I can hear from someone else. Well, like feedback. I think I gave it just a little bit recently, when we, in principle, closed this issue. Not closed, but discussed. Well, and now to say that everything...
Speaker A: You don't have to, well, if that's all, then you don't have to say anything else.
Speaker B: Nothing to say. Yes, to be honest, there is nothing to say. Words of gratitude.
Speaker A: Well, then let's finish. I'm glad that somehow I got what I wanted in those 50 minutes.
Speaker B: Thank you very much.
Speaker A: Yes, happily. You then disconnect, and I... will continue.
Speaker B: I'm going straight out, right? I'm going straight out. That's it, thank you, goodbye.
Speaker A: Good luck. That's it, you and I are left alone. For me, this meeting, you know, is some kind of joke on the Internet among programmers that if the code works, then you don't have to get into it, because you will definitely ruin something, even if it works crookedly. For me, this meeting is about something similar, not that something works crookedly, but that you need to work with where there is a request. Well, the client really somehow learned to cope with this life. And it wasn't obvious to me when she talked about certain things that they were bothering her. And, in fact, I set tasks for myself to clarify whether they interfere or not. And in response, in general, I often received the fact that yes, everything is, in general, normal, and that it was important to formulate and say it. And for me personally, this is such a reminder that it is important not to work without a request. That we, psychologists, should work within the framework that the client exposes to us. If he doesn't want to go somewhere, then we shouldn't go there. If you noticed, I was probing the ground somehow. If there was any response, then I offered to go somewhere. If there was no response, then we stayed where we are. It is ok. and that's fine, and that's fine. In general, it would be possible to go a lot of places, of course, and it is clear that there are a lot of feelings about losses, and future losses, and a high level of tension, but that's all, you can go to all these sides, exactly the moment when these parties begin to worry, So within the framework of this meeting, in my opinion, everything turned out very clearly and very well. Ask questions in the comments if it is important for you to clarify something. In the meantime, in conclusion, let me remind you that I want to start my tutoring groups once a month. Those who have known me for a long time know that this is a great thing. Those who have not been to them yet, I sincerely advertise them to you. Once a month. Next Tuesday will be the first from 8 pm to 10 pm in an online format. This is a format in which we will hold live demo meetings between participants, and then observers will give feedback to consultants. I will also give my feedback. Maybe I will even hold, if there is a desire, some demo sessions on my part, if there is a desire from the participants. In general, you can read about all this in my telegram channel, the link will be in the description. Come, I will be glad to see you. The number of seats is limited due to the fact that this is an open live band, not because I want you to.
Speaker B: Her.
Speaker A: Sell as best and dearer as possible. Come and see you next week. And I will try to open a new format this week. Follow the channel. Everything. Said a lot? Happily.
