Speaker B: I would say no rather than yes, I have a psychologist friend, but due to the fact that there is still a point of professional ethics, it is impossible to fully interact with a psychologist or a psychotherapist there. Here, but nevertheless, as if how the work goes, I have an idea.
Speaker A: Okay, okay. What brings you here?
Speaker B: Panic attacks. In a very rigid form. Started with a crown. The first attack came on the first day of the illness. And after this attack, I was turned off from life for literally three days. That is, such weakness has set in that I can't just get up for three days. all this time I have to sit on some sedatives so that my tachycardia just doesn't cover me like this, so as not to go crazy from some creepy, completely obsessive thoughts, and which have no basis in themselves. And due to the fact that the attacks began to recur, maybe once a week, maybe once every two weeks, sometimes it happens twice a week. That is, for the past three months, this problem has been driving me crazy.
Speaker A: But the pandemic has been going on for more than two years? Or did it start with your illness?
Speaker B: No, it started with the disease. Before that, there were no such people at all. Well, as if I'm an ordinary person, yes, I have stress, but there are ways to adequately live it. But this time it feels like I just blew the slate. In the worst sense, unfortunately.
Speaker A: What pills do you take?
Speaker B: After going to the cardiologist, well, in order to make sure that this is not a complication, there was something else on the heart, they prescribed an anti-anxiety medication, grendexin, or something. But I've only been drinking them for 5 days, that is, I don't want to sit on pills and still want to work out some way, well, to stabilize myself. Well, plus the pulse is lowering. This is already more mechanical. Well, magnesium. All. There is nothing big like that.
Speaker A: And how does it help?
Speaker B: Well, from magnesium, at least I started sleeping. That is, there is no such thing that you go to bed, and instead of falling asleep, you start chasing some wild thoughts completely. By type... Damn, what if I don't wake up? And suddenly something like this happens in a dream, which is straight... Bam, that's it. And I'm there, I don't know if I'm going to die or something.
Speaker A: Well, that is... These are the thoughts around... Around death, as it were?
Speaker B: Either around some terrible disease that will lead to death, or, well, death itself directly. With... I didn't notice the fear of death before. There was no such thing that I would just slide into such thoughts, into such a state. And now it's out of control. Mentally, I can't calm myself anymore, although I know some techniques plus or minus. To find a certain color of an object in the room, switch to the effect of hearing, touch, taste in the end. It doesn't work. I mean, when it hits really hard, I don't know what to do. I just want to meow on the walls.
Speaker A: Can you describe these attacks, how it happens?
Speaker B: Probably, as if there are several phases of some kind. At first, it just starts some kind of jitters, as if before the competition you need to go to the start now, that's the type. Then it's like these disturbing thoughts are added to this jitters, damn, what if I have something with my heart or nerves or something else. And then the mechanism starts, tachycardia enters, and after that all that. And I'm already becoming some kind of inadequate person, because it's hard to even get distracted from it.
Speaker A: And that's what it is for... What's going on inside this?
Speaker B: The fear of death turns on. I think I'm going to die now. So. And... well, I don't know. The attack lasts for some time, this acute phase, I don't know, it can take up to 20 minutes, up to 40, but that's if I still accelerate myself. That is, I understand that the peak, it's 10-20 minutes somewhere, like this, when it's right up to this. And then, well, if I screwed myself up, then yes, 40 minutes, and then I just go to bed, and how much it turns out, well, I can just not get up until the evening.
Speaker A: You can think about death for 40 minutes, and these are some kind of panic thoughts.
Speaker B: I know that this is a topic for therapy, and I probably feel that way for six months of therapy, because I do not know what could have led me to this. It didn't come from the ceiling and turn on, everything has a reason. Well, except biological, of course.
Speaker A: She is not always what you want her to be. I mean, some specific one.
Speaker B: I just want to find her, get rid of her. Well, I won't say that it's agoraphobia, that is, well, the fear that I'm going to have an attack right now among people, but sometimes it comes to this, that is, well, social life has been very much defeated now, because, let's say, there are already interactions with a bunch of people, there, with friends, with relatives, so that there are a lot of them, I can no longer, I feel uncomfortable. That is, if something, well, like something, If I get scared again and this whole attack comes, I just don't want to make other people uncomfortable with this state of mine, because I don't know what to do with it myself. God bless you. And more.
Speaker A: Thank you.
Speaker B: Here. And they certainly don't know. That is, I won't even be able to give any instructions on how to help myself in this matter. That's probably the whole problem.
Speaker A: And how did you get over covid?
Speaker B: Well, probably easy enough. Firstly, at home, and secondly, the acute phase of the disease took me only 5 days. It was just the temperature and nothing more. Well, the temperature and weakness, and that's it. And then just a decline in strength, probably, like many. You've been walking around like this for a month, your head is spinning there. There is no strength for anything, a lot of vitamins, well, to at least somehow restore yourself. Well, that's it. That is, well, a month, probably, it took me all this recovery. But then it's like euphoria, like everything is wonderful, it seems like even recovery has come, but it seems like this organism has reached some last fuel, turned on like this, yes, yes, we can, everything is fine, then that's enough. Well, February 24 also affected. That is, I wake up, and my fiance says to me, listen, figure it out, we have a war started. I say what?
Speaker A: What do you mean?
Speaker B: Well, that day I also had an attack, but it was already an attack provoked by something else. Well, firstly, the fear that now if the whole thing takes the most shitty turn, he will be called. "You do nothing, take it away, I don't need it, please, I don't support all this nonsense at all." Secondly, such an event will affect absolutely everything, and how we will continue to live as a whole country, people who did not want to take part in all this. That is, it somehow started with a global one and rolls back on me as a human participant, or rather, not even a participant, Well, yes, just as a witness to all these events of a silent one who can't do anything. Well, with a frequency of once every 10 days, once a week, these attacks are repeated. Sometimes in full force, sometimes I still manage to somehow grab myself and not let it all unfold further.
Speaker A: Have the seizures worsened since the 24th? That is, is there any dynamics?
Speaker B: The frequency has increased. The frequency has increased. That is, here on February 5, February 24 and then it starts serious once a week. I never thought that... something like this can happen to me at all. That is, he always considered himself a person who, well, at least, can release his own emotions and cope with stress too. And here it's like, well, I'm losing control of my body. It's like it doesn't belong to me at all. That is, it somehow does something somewhere, and I'm like that... Wow! Well, that's great. What am I supposed to do with you?
Speaker A: In general, it's often the most frightening thing about panic attacks that something happens that you don't control at all. What task could you set for our meeting today? After all, we have one and such a separate one.
Speaker B: Goal. Well, it's clear that, most likely, one meeting will not help me straight bang and get rid of it, but perhaps to fully understand this mechanism so that I can at least, I don't know, at the level of the spinal cord try to track this while the brain is stirring up some of its creepy perfect I do not know the thoughts to reflect on this moment somehow, because If I am aware of this process, it means that I have at least some kind of power over it. That is, I am no longer inside him, but watching as if from the outside. At least so. Because, well, probably the rest takes longer, I don't know. And more meetings, respectively.
Speaker A: To reflect on your feelings about your panic attacks, am I right?
Speaker B: Either to disassemble the whole process as a skeleton, that is, that's what it consists of and at what point I can still, well, somehow still seize control over it and not let it unwind into something more.
Speaker A: You say that you know the techniques about colors, about breathing things. Does it help in any way?
Speaker B: Breathing helps. Breath control is somehow something else somewhere. But if I missed, or even not what I missed, and if I am in interaction with another person at the moment of this slight stress, we are just talking there, discussing something, then well, it's like I can't focus on this nascent moment.
Speaker A: And how is it? Describe it. That is, it's something small, isn't it?
Speaker B: Absolutely, yes. That is, some kind of mild stress, slight nervous excitement, which can be provoked by a conversation. We discussed the film like that yesterday. And I felt that at the moment of discussion for some reason I was getting nervous, for some reason I was getting uncomfortable because of something. Moreover, we were talking about some kind of struggle, not a struggle, I don't even remember anymore. And as soon as this struggle comes up, the need to compete and there are some other moments, it began. Slowly. I feel that way. So, listen, let's change the subject. I can't discuss this right now, for some reason it's hard for me. Changed the subject, it became easier. Here. And, well, the more often these topics pop up there with struggle, with competition, with... How to say in Russian what is called? with the changeability of everything that happens, the need to adapt to it, the scarier it becomes for me.
Speaker A: What is this about? Is this about the 24th?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So it's generally about some kind of unpredictability of space, which somehow became our reality?
Speaker B: Yes. In the period before, I roughly understood how things functioned, and all this had some kind of plus or minus predictable scenario. Either there, or there, or there. Here you have three branches, and you are already coming up with some kind of plan for all three branches. And now you just don't know. When you wake up, what will happen? Well, up to this. Yes, it also adds a lot of anxiety.
Speaker A: And how did this affect your personal life? At work, on plans?
Speaker B: It has become very difficult to work, because my work is directly related to people. That is, I give consultations myself, but for me these consultations are related to building a personal style. That is, I am a stylist and archetype consultant. Here. If earlier, for example, I could hold 2-3 consultations a day completely calmly, that is, it filled me, it's a cool live process, it's communication with people, now there is one consultation and a maximum of once every 2 days.
Speaker A: So there is less work?
Speaker B: Yes. She just doesn't have enough of me anymore, and I feel like I don't have the strength. And on personal life... Well, fortunately, the groom only supports me in all this. Of course, we had a dialogue once. "What are you afraid of? Explain to me how to help you? Why are you scared?" I say, I don't know, I'm just afraid to die. I do not know where it comes from. It's irrational, but I can't help myself. Well, actually, I went to the cardiologist from his filing just. The gynecologist looked at me, said, well, I congratulate you, you have a neurosis. That is, you have ideal indicators, the heart can either get pregnant or become an astronaut, at your discretion. Well, I'm sorry, well, that's it. Support physics and go to therapy.
Speaker A: A good lender.
Speaker B: It also made me laugh, of course. I kind of hoped for such an outcome. I think, well, just let me have a heart, let me have a heart. Please, I'm only 26 years old, and I still want to stay at least 40 years old and somehow live this whole period without all these terrible excuses. Well, okay, we found out that neurosis. And what should I do with this next?
Speaker A: Something like that. At the same time, you said that you had been drinking medicines for only 5 days. Do you have a principled position?
Speaker B: No, it's not something that's fundamentally simple... Well, of course, they told me that they don't get hooked on this grindoxin, no matter how completely calm you can get off there at any time, and nothing terrible will happen. Just the effect of them was... Positive emotions all very easily fly by, easily arise, and somewhere even have some kind of hysterical background. That is, you can just laugh at jokes, or you can slide into such a loud laugh, which, well, really, gives off hysteria. And for negative emotions, it's like the block is standing on them like this, that is, they were pressed by a cast-iron stove, and that's it. And this inferiority of my own reactions prompted me to the fact that for 5 days I don't let myself twitch, okay, but after that I get off. That is, yes, it will be difficult for me, I will still be covered, perhaps, but I'd rather limit myself to magnesium and pulse-lowering drugs. Let it be better so, but at least it's not an influence here, on the brain specifically. That is, the sinus node, okay, they will only control it, okay. Probably so, yes.
Speaker A: I want to share that there is a physical component and there is a psychological component.
Speaker B: Yes, I understand.
Speaker A: Like, what to do with the physical, plus or minus is clear. Medication support, breathing, distraction. Well, in general, you know it yourself and you have some kind of set for yourself... I'll try, at least, yes. Somehow you are looking for possible options for yourself. There is a psychological component. Maybe I'm wrong, fix it. It seems to me that somehow the main thing that bothers you in these panic attacks is the fear of death. That is, there is not the attack itself, but this plume, after the fact, which has been happening to you for a long time. And at the same time you say that you have not experienced the fear of death before.
Speaker B: Which is shocking. I admit where it could have come from, but for some reason it seemed to me that I had already lived these two moments, because they were quite a long time ago. When I was eight years old, my father was killed, killed because of a very large sum of money and there were some other frauds, I can't remember now. At the moment when it happened, it seemed to me that it didn't seem to bother me at all. I didn't cry, I didn't get upset. I mean, well, it was like I was under a dome of some kind. She got there, she did it before me by the age of 14-15. That is, it has already clicked there. Hi, you don't have a father. Hello, wake up.
Speaker A: So it took us, in general, 6 years.
Speaker B: Yes. Yes, that is, that's how much at some point I slowed down all these moments, I don't know how, but I did it. Here. And somewhere in the same interval, grandfather dies. Well, the death of a grandfather and the death of a father are still slightly different weight categories in terms of grief. But, nevertheless, how would these moments happen. Ten years. Ten years have passed since that moment, and what, did it really suddenly come to me now that against the background of these two deaths, I began to be afraid of my own? Well, I don't know, I think it's somehow... Well, that's weird. Even for my pens. I know how to drive there, yes, and spin some thoughts, but not as much. Or I don't know something about myself, which I also quite admit.
Speaker A: I would like to say that you are looking for some kind of clear algorithm, or something. Well, like, it happens to me because, I don't know, my father was killed eight years ago. But there may be an explanation... Generally different. Generally different. And it may not be. Well, in the sense that sometimes panic attacks just happen.
Speaker B: I just, I mean, I don't have any trigger under me.
Speaker A: Well, yes. Well, the trigger is understandable. Three years of a pandemic, during which, this is my fantasy, during which some kind of general global excitement and anxiety could not but spread to you, and in the end you got sick. This could have been a trigger in itself. It's like you've been waiting for something for a long time, you're afraid of something, then it happens. and lies down at night in the fertile soil. And it can be explained like this. Or it can be explained by the death of your father at your age of eight. Or maybe both. And maybe both, and the other, and the third. In the sense that I don't think any logical understanding at this point can help much.
Speaker B: This is probably my attempt to stabilize myself. If I can explain something to myself and find some kind of sequence that pulled me, then this gives me the opportunity, after all, but to control the situation. If I understand the situation, I control it. If I don't understand her, my hair starts to sit, and I'm scared.
Speaker A: Tell us about your fear of death. I understand that this is a very general question, but I want to ask it like this.
Speaker B: Life has just begun to take shape, which I have always aspired to. I finally started doing what I love, that is, counseling. Somewhere there I am studying the language, but now I don't need to focus on it absolutely all my strength, I don't need to work out a diploma. I have a loved one, I have established contact with my parents, I have friends, I started traveling. Yes, I just don't want my wonderful life to end at this stage. I like her, and I want her to move on. That's why, well, fear, death, or rather, in this regard, it's me... it's probably most annoying from the position that the beautiful thing that I have now, it can take and end. And worse, if we consider death as a barrier, and not as a condition after which it's nothing if, roughly speaking, I have to go through the same life again in the next life in order to come to the same results that I have. I don't want this. I mean, well... I don't know if you believe in reincarnation, but here, probably, somewhere fear is also based on this.
Speaker A: If I assume that the situation with your disease is covid somehow... She suddenly made it clear that, in general, life is finite.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Will this be true? Well, what is it? The first experience of meeting something so serious?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Which can end very badly.
Speaker B: Yes, because at least other diseases... Humanity has an idea of how to deal with them and what can be done, but this is something new for everyone, and when no one really knows what to do. My mom also got sick, and she got sick very hard. She was admitted to the hospital. It happened in the summer of that year. And that's when I realized that no one knows how to conduct treatment in the hospital. There, everything can turn around for the better, and for the worse. That's when I started to fear that she might die. And I won't even see her before that. I'm here, she's in another city, in Lipetsk. Even if I go there now, it won't do me any good anyway, because they won't let me go there. And then I won't see her.
Speaker A: In general, it's scary.
Speaker B: And this, too, probably still affected. If we consider this in the chain of all these events, which scared somewhere, knocked the ground out from under our feet, then this also has a strong enough effect.
Speaker A: In general, as a psychotherapist, I observe such a trend. Maybe it will help you, I will share it. In general, what you describe, I've been seeing a lot lately. It is in the context of covid. In the sense that few people think about death. And few people... Well, that is, in general, in a good way, it passes in adolescence, but not all. Well, how is it, the first meetings with the inner fear of death. But, as it turned out, this is not exactly happening. And for many covid and covid disease, it has become such a trigger, well, when you seem to suddenly... You live some kind of your usual life with travel, with a schedule and plans, and suddenly you realize that you are finite. I have faced panic attacks many times against this background. It's just like some kind of abyss that has opened up. You live, you live, and then one day, and suddenly it turns out.
Speaker B: And most importantly, do not spit into this abyss, because it can spit back. Sorry, I'm being ironic just to make myself feel better.
Speaker A: Do you have a feeling rising now somehow?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Can you describe them? I see that your eyes have, so to speak, moistened a little.
Speaker B: I... I can't even describe it, but for some reason I want to cry.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Sort of... I won't even tell you the reason right now, but what you're saying, well, yes, it is. Maybe it's just that it is, but it feels like that to me now. But I don't want to, because it will be difficult for me to calm down later, and it will be to some extent a waste of time.
Speaker A: So it definitely won't be?
Speaker B: Well, yes. That's all you said about the limbs, and about this abyss.
Speaker A: Yes, that's right. Well, it's really scary.
Speaker B: It's probably more strange now that the fear that I consider myself to be somehow so irrational and interfering with life, has now been recognized. Like, that's it... This is normal, and I have the right to it. That is, it seems as if before that I had not given myself the opportunity to take it and say that yes, it's mine. Yes, I'm with this.
Speaker A: You know, there is one... Few people talk about it. In general, death is a very taboo topic. At the same time, within the framework of Individual work with clients, we reach this periodically. But there is little talk about this in society. And there is some kind of illusion that this is not happening to anyone. That everyone somehow copes with this fear. Or he doesn't have them.
Speaker B: Or they just somehow go around it in an arc like this on a big one. And here is death separately, and I am somewhere there. And we don't cross paths. This topic pops up in my mind, and I think I'm starting to understand what I am... Understanding and analyzing with the brain is one thing. That is, when you can decompose the same rebel archetype into some structural components for another person. That is, what a person is going through, what he may be experiencing, being in this and dressing appropriately. But now I understand that all this had a layer that I couldn't get into in any way, because I didn't miss it through myself. And there is a face-to-face encounter with death, well, this is a very metaphorical meaning. I don't think I met her metaphorically anymore. I've already met her face to face. First through a person dear to me, through my mother, and then little by little through myself. Despite the fact that I invented it for myself, of course, objectively there is no reason to die, let's say. No illness, there's nothing there, and cars don't follow me to knock me down. I mean in this regard. Cool, I met this.
Speaker A: Well, do you meet with this when you have panic attacks?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Well, it's always like this, even if it's short-term, but the experience of the bodily experience of dying.
Speaker B: Moreover, when derealization occurs as one of the signs and ... Decipher it. Well, this is when you have a body, and you seem to fly out of it a little bit and think that, damn, it's cool, and now it seems that you will faint. And I understand that it will not be, and it's just some kind of... a feeling, I don't know, whose control is not amenable. But at this moment, I just remember when it came, I clung to my man's hand and said, so, now we're standing for five minutes, I'm going to ground myself, as they say, and we'll go on. He asks what happened. I say, well, I do not know yet how to describe it to you, now I'll get together and tell you. But that was it. I mean, it's like I looked down on myself. And this is how the body starts to drive from this side to the side, and you think, now the knees will bend, and I'm pouring somewhere here. Although I'm in the dark, in general, the nerves did not fall from life. But only once, when I hit my elbow with this part very hard, there are a lot of nerve endings, there I sat down on my knees, because everything in front of my eyes went dark. So, my God, what did this even happen? Well, then I realized. More elbows did not beat.
Speaker A: The main fear of childhood, yes. to catch an elbow.
Speaker B: Only the little toe is worse. Well, we've already accepted that. Like that. Yes, it's very strange for me to talk, probably, about death, because I was probably also the person who bypassed this topic and his attitude to it, too, along this very wide arc. That's why me... It's strange to me. I don't know yet how to describe my condition now. And you when... Well, you give some thought and leave a pause. This pause is very cool to think about. A very strange therapeutic silence. This is the first time I notice this. Because usually there are practically no pauses in the conversation. And to think, to think, to pull something out of yourself at this moment is not possible.
Speaker A: Well, it comes with experience. The ability to be silent.
Speaker B: But, by the way, it's hard to be in silence at the same time for some reason.
Speaker A: Well, it's unusual.
Speaker B: Yes, very much.
Speaker A: Be close to two people and be silent.
Speaker B: But still silence, it's again for some reason about uncertainty, about not understanding what will happen next. And ... There would be some other thought, I can't get it out. I guess I just don't like being in silence. There should be something making noise around me all the time, talking. Since childhood, it has somehow happened. That is, I may not watch TV, but it just makes noise somewhere in the background. Parents just very often left one at home. And in order to somehow kill this silence, I turned on the TV all the time, went about my business. And now I feel that it is very uncomfortable for me to be in silence. Although objectively there is nothing wrong with it.
Speaker A: She's unusual. How would your request sound now? It seems that we have made some progress, somehow your fear has been legalized, and you have relaxed a little. And what would be relevant for you now? Maybe the same thing, but in some other way? What did you want to talk about?
Speaker B: For some reason, it seems to me that I'm going to move very much from the topic of the original request. Extremely. In general, it seems to be in the other direction. I'm afraid of being alone.
Speaker A: In my opinion, they haven't moved out.
Speaker B: And... the fear of loneliness has been with me, well, probably as long as I consciously remember myself. That is, this... This is a very old story, it stretches there since, I don't know, probably, this is my age. In front of my parents, I remember, I was always brave, yes, yes, I'll sit alone at home, well, God, what do I need, I'm not afraid of anything. But really... It has never been very comfortable. It's still such a cool time there, but no one really had mobile phones. There was also no opportunity to call and ask your parents where you are when you arrive. And that's why you're somehow in this expectation, in this uncertainty and also in misunderstanding when someone will return there, You have no choice but to just be in it. Well, get distracted, wait, but you won't get out of this. And all this, well, probably stretched out for the rest of my life. Everything remained exactly the same. In silence I can... Even if I go into meditation, I must have some music in the background. I will never sit alone in a room to just look at the wall there, I do not know, and try not to think about anything. No. Neither in silence, nor alone, and not that's all. Music is required. for some reason I thought it didn't bother me, well, there is such a feature, there is. And now I think that, it seems, well, it definitely does not add strength to me. And fullness, yes, perhaps, too. Because on this fear of loneliness, you can pick up friends who are not quite adequate, and climb into crooked relationships, and everything else. Here, well, with relationships, at least, it seems to me, after all, I was able not to get into such a dependent option, because, fortunately, my fiance is such a periodically departing friend, he has business trips, and these business trips can reach, I don't know, for two months completely calm. That is, willy-nilly, but you still have to be alone, that is, without him in the apartment. And I am even glad about it somewhere, because it does not allow me to fall into some kind of dependence on a person. And I don't want to let that happen. I want to leave the relationship clean, without these dependencies.
Speaker A: You started this part with the fact that you can't be alone. Now you are talking about what you are and coping with. What is the difficulty then? Or did you just discover it?
Speaker B: Yes, it was more like now, at the moment of thinking for some reason. This is what I'm holding on to, I'm trying to fight this fear of loneliness, but I can't get rid of it. When you resist, it's still not a mechanism for adequate living, it seems to me. And the bottom line is that he hasn't gone anywhere. Well, he overcame it, so I tried it there, at least, okay, for a few months. And he's not gone anywhere, I'm still here, I'm with you, I'm not going anywhere until you figure out where I came from and what the two of us are going to do together. Well, I'm organizing again, yes.
Speaker A: And what happens to you alone?
Speaker B: A frenzied thought-stirrer turns on. It seems to me that I can think about everything, up to how Pythagoras' theorem was derived and where he wrote it all. That is, well, the flow of thoughts is such that you dig into it and can't get out of there.
Speaker A: Can this be called anxiety?
Speaker B: Yes. Well, because you have to at least do something to occupy yourself, so that you don't stay in some kind of vacuum, or something. Because if the brain doesn't think, if nothing happens around, then it's like being in the void. So yes, it looks like an alarm. Quite. It's strange, I've never looked from such a side.
Speaker A: You just describe a certain state in which thoughts cling to anything.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Well, it seems to me to be some kind of inner tension, which in an understandable way catches Pythagoras, then something else. Just to direct this flow somewhere.
Speaker B: Activity.
Speaker A: This is how the alarm usually works.
Speaker B: Well, it means that now it has been confirmed that I am really a highly anxious person. Well, that is, as it were, a doctor from another practice said about it at all, but I mean a cardiologist just the same. Well, neuroticism, anxiety, here you are, please, pills. At least somehow to hold this case. Well, now I'm starting to make sure that it really is, that is, that it's not taken from under that Kabul, or something.
Speaker A: Opening day?
Speaker B: Yes, very much. Well, when, probably, you live in the confidence that you can cope with a lot of things, and, my God, where has ours not disappeared, and then this comes out to you, well, as if from behind a curtain, here. You are in a room, it seems to you that there is no one else in this room except you, and then the curtain is pulled back and such a "Hello". And we are here, and we are with you. Yes, it's very strange for me right now.
Speaker A: How strange is it?
Speaker B: Well, it's like you see yourself from a new side. That is, I thought that you already know a certain number of faces about yourself, and you think that this number of faces has frozen in a certain amount, and then another new one is added to them, and for which you were not ready. Such a kind of dark side of the moon.
Speaker A: So, today we found out that you are afraid of death, and you are an anxious person.
Speaker B: Yes. And something has to be done about it. Although, maybe this is the desire to do something, it is based on anxiety, among other things. That is, I can't just accept this fact, and I need to turn on some kind of active activity in order to somehow fix this matter. Well, in my opinion, I even have nervous motor skills. Ordinary people, when they talk, their gestures are slower. I now catch the fact that even when I show something with gestures, I have some kind of nervous twitching. Maybe it didn't match the request, but, nevertheless, this is an interesting discovery. Very straight.
Speaker A: I am impressed by the fact that you analyze it somehow, well, you yourself, in general, find the answers. Well, like, maybe to accept it, maybe not to fight with it, maybe not to look for a way out right away, but just to be in it somehow.
Speaker B: It seems like it's going to be difficult because I've never done that. That is, as soon as a problem arises, I'm not one of those people who sticks to it, I immediately start looking for solutions. Well, again, this is also a very old mechanism. It's been worked out there since school, probably. And it's like I was taught that way. Well, what are you sitting waiting for? Go decide. Well, there was a problem with it. I'm not speaking in my own words right now.
Speaker A: Whose?
Speaker B: Mom's. How I would have reacted to it back then, I don't remember, but I remember her words, which are now spinning in my head. without glossing over the problem, telling, we will solve it. But for some reason, it is "we will solve it" that remains from this piece of phrase. But now I have to do it on my own, the separation has been going on for a long time, and, well, I don't feel like a person dependent on my mother anymore. That is, such a full-fledged one, sorry, that's all. That's, well, cool. I'll have to write it down and think about it somehow. Here.
Speaker A: The third opening.
Speaker B: In an hour. And you didn't talk that much. I've already talked about therapeutic silence.
Speaker A: Well, that's how it works. I don't have to say much here.
Speaker B: Irina Giberman talked a lot about this effect. Well, a Russian psychologist, but she's working now... More precisely, not a psychologist, a psychotherapist, probably, after all. She is currently working in Germany, and I have seen a lot about the effect of this silence from her, but I have never understood how it works. I just felt it for myself.
Speaker A: It turns out it's like this. I would call it a presence effect. It's not just silence. Silence is one of the tools. This is generally about my presence. Well, I'm listening to you, I'm asking clarifying questions, I'm attentive. And when something like that... When someone treats you like that next to you, then you yourself begin to see something about yourself that you haven't seen before. you formulate your thoughts somehow in a new way, reflecting yourself.
Speaker B: Yeah. Some kind of mirror is working. Only this mirror still has ears and it's like a map that it can guide you. So, I need to be with this, and I need to digest it. Well, at least that's out of all those three things that have now surfaced.
Speaker A: Yeah. Something like that. We still have five minutes. You have the right to dispose as you want. I can see that you are a little shocked right now. Or confused, I don't know how to do it right. And that, and that. If you want to be in this, so that I can be around, then we can do so. If you want, let's say, to finish this and go for a drink of water, we can do this. If you want to talk about something, then you can also dispose of it as you want. It's important to me... to inform that there is such freedom of action.
Speaker B: It would probably be convenient for me now if you asked some question. Moreover, it probably doesn't even matter what this issue will be related to.
Speaker A: And to what?
Speaker B: Well, probably not to dive into these thoughts and not to spin them. As if, well, well, I remembered them for myself, but for some reason, here... To wrap up all these realizations to the end, I feel comfortable here.
Speaker A: Well, that's impossible. Such a volume to drink immediately. When we are done with you, you will go outside, and your thoughts will catch up with you for some time. You will have an internal dialogue going on. I do not know, an hour, two, a day, a week, I do not know how it will happen. But to the fact that the process will not end at our immediate end. He will be with you... And to the fact that some of our discoveries, they will have time to lie down. And that's fine. That's why I don't have a goal to tell you something to pull you out. It is much more therapeutic in this sense if the session ends with a comma.
Speaker B: Once a week, I do not know how it is usually done, maybe once every two weeks. I just think that if it were, probably, somehow more often, I just wouldn't have time to think about it all and unwind. I understand that now a day will pass, I will still be overwhelmed by emotions, sober thoughts will come, well, for the good of the second day, and something... Indeed, such a calming and stabilizing will open somewhere on the third of September. Well, because the first time is everything.
Speaker A: Time on emotions, because it's a shock of some kind.
Speaker B: You don't expect this from yourself, it appears, you need to think about it, and after some time it will just decompose. I really don't know what. And again, this "I do not know what it can decompose into and what I will come to" is also to launch some kind of nervous, in the sense of a frightening process, probably.
Speaker A: Well, uncertainty is scary.
Speaker B: And again we're back to that.
Speaker A: The circle has closed.
Speaker B: A closed circle, a closed room, a space, some kind of associative series was dedicated. Here again I want to break out of this circle, just for the sake of being alone for me and not stewing in all this.
Speaker A: And let's finish this, because we have time, and in general, I think it makes sense to put a comma on this. And break out of this room with a blackout.
Speaker B: And in Russian I said, don't leave the room, don't make a mistake.
Speaker A: Well, he wasn't the most cheerful person, yes. Feedback. At the very beginning of the consultation, I had a hypothesis that the client was more concerned about not the panic attacks themselves, not so much panic attacks, as the fear of death that came with them. She emphasized on this that for 20, 30, 40 minutes she can turn thoughts inside about death, about her own. And in this regard, I hypothesized for this session, for this meeting, that in general this fear should be legalized, because indeed the fear of death is a very taboo topic. Few people talk about him, little is written about him, and it feels like there is no such thing. And when a person encounters him at one time or another, there is often a feeling that this is something extraordinary and that something is very, very wrong with me. That is why I focused so much on the fact that this is normal, that especially against the background of the pandemic, these fears began to intensify. And it's true. A lot of clients began to come with this with such a sudden realization that, Lord, it turns out that I am finite. This is a very difficult experience. If you've ever come across him, then I think you know what I mean. If I remember correctly, Melanie Klein had such an idea that after the narcissistic comes the depressive, that in general often the fear of death, it somehow makes you reconsider and dig through your inner world, which before this cutoff was so very bright, saturated, on the run. this world can turn into one... after that, there can be such a very deep dive into depression. It seems to me that this client is in this process, that in general, if we worked further, we would meet with such strong deep feelings, with sadness, with the fear of loneliness. We touched on this to some extent towards the end. I think that our work would have been built around this in such a smooth dive and then a smooth ascent. And these obsessive thoughts about the fear of death, and the condition that the client faces in bouts of loneliness, both are very similar to the manifestation of anxiety. that, as if in general, when such silence comes, a lot of feelings appear inside, which, perhaps, before the pandemic, before meeting with the disease, were not very identified at all. I wanted to formulate this, but for some reason I did not during the consultation, that I would say that it looks exactly like the fear of silence, not the fear of loneliness, but the fear of silence, as if in general, when everything around is quiet, it becomes very anxious inside. As about the TV turned on. If the TV is turned off, if there is no music during meditation, then it becomes scary at all. Because in general, our world is arranged in such a way that it maximally contributes to ensuring that we do not meet with what is happening inside us. Music, TV, phones, social networks — all this is aimed at making us move somewhere all the time, so that there is a feeling of some kind of movement, some kind of informational noise. And being outside of it is very unusual.
