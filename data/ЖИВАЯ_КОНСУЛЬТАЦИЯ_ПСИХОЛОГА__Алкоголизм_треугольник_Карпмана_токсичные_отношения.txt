Speaker B: Yes. Moreover, I have both positive and very negative experiences. I've been in therapy for a total of 4 years. And now, after these 4 years, it seemed to me that I had worked out some painful moments and, in principle, I could move on. Well, as it turned out, not quite worked. That's why I have such a request to go to therapy again now, because something, something is unfinished, it comes out, or it comes out a little bit with some other prakas, but, in general, soap and washcloth start all over again. Here, something like that. That is, I want to say that when I found myself in therapy, I'm sitting here with you now, quite calm, even joking. It's clear that when I came there 5 years ago, I was just crying, I was terribly depressed, but now I'm just cheerfully drinking pills, drinking wine and busy 24 to 7, so I don't have much time, I realized today on the inside.
Speaker A: What kind of pills are you taking?
Speaker B: Now I have very simple ones. Right now I'm just on phenibut. And Mom still drinks to sleep at night. Here. Light-hearted.
Speaker A: Phenibut, wine and a lot of work.
Speaker B: Well, yes, yes, yes. And study. That's what I'm good at.
Speaker A: And how does it help?
Speaker B: Well... Well, yes, definitely. Because I've been in this mode for probably a year. And somehow I was in it normally, but now I come to this, as you know, I call it, driven horses are shot, aren't they?
Speaker A: Do you feel like a cornered horse?
Speaker B: Well, in general, I remind myself, I don't even remind myself of a horse, but a greyhound, it seems to me, it's straight, it seems to me, firstly, these are very beautiful dogs, but they are always running, running, running, running, running, running, and they look like this Just beautiful dogs taken away.
Speaker A: Why are you running? And run, and run, and run.
Speaker B: I think there's no way I can work it out. Well, that is, I now understand in general. I thought I was just very cheerfully preparing for emigration. I study and work. And in general, I'm also a mom. And from all sides, I'm wow. Well, not that wow, but just from all sides I'm spinning here. And now I realize that I, in fact, throw a lot just because... Just because I have some problem, I do not know how to solve it. I ponder, ponder, and so and so, and reflect. And still, every time I find out after the fact that it's the same thing again.
Speaker A: So you are running away from some kind of problem?
Speaker B: I'm running, probably, more from an internal conversation with myself and, probably, yes, from this problem, because I do not know how to solve it. Yes, I do not know how to solve it. It turns out she's some kind of... here.
Speaker A: Can you formulate it then?
Speaker B: Yes. I think... I tried to formulate it, in fact, before meeting with you, so that we don't spend too much time on it. It seems to me that I don't know how to set personal boundaries in any way, so with me... Therefore, they are regularly violated and I am treated badly. I mean not only the men with whom I am in a relationship, but, for example, the employer. I am not very sure that I am building a relationship correctly, for example, with my own son. And it often seems to me that we don't have the attitude of an adult child, but something else already. This is not quite true, it gives him some kind of instability. And we ended up in therapy because I have problems with my child. 5 years ago, this was also all relevant. Here. That is, I sort of lived, passed, solved there, as it seemed to me, problems with my parents, that this is all from my parents, bry-bry-bry-bry. But it's not. It is not devoid, it turns out. Something like that.
Speaker A: Do you have an explanation why this has become relevant for you now? You say that a year, if I understand correctly, without therapy, And somehow now the stars have come together so that you decided to apply?
Speaker B: I'm just... Either... I actually think I'm a giraffe. That's by nature. You know, there's a man there, there's a monkey there, I can't monkey all night... Oh, he poisons jokes all day, the giraffe laughs at them all night. I think I'm a giraffe in general. That is, it comes to me very often a bullet. And now, for example, it has begun to dawn on me that for the last two or three years... the relationships with men that I entered into, they were all about the fact that they regularly violated my personal boundaries, their ability to defend them, for example, they poured all their negativity into me, and I listened cheerfully and was such a key. This is now I'm suddenly starting to understand, but it didn't reach me before. And now I somehow at some point here, I do not know, the stars came together, I read maybe some book or movie, something clicked like that, I realized that no, the problem did not go away. If there were men there five years ago who robbed me and said, yes, you're not ugly there at all, you're nobody there, how dare you. They don't tell me that anymore. But now, for example, I'm listening about all their troubles, about all their problems. And, for example, many of them do not know the names of my brothers and sisters. And for a moment I grew up in a large family. Well, it may also be important to know who you're meeting there, where this woman came from, yes. Well, that is, nothing at all about me, but I'm listening to about your business, about your grandmother's three cats. there, I do not know, about all-all-all global problems, about all the trips you have been on.
Speaker A: It's like you're becoming such a psychologist for men. Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker B: You see, my consultations then must be expensive, since I listen to your this is all friend-friend. I don't understand it at the moment, I never do. And then suddenly, somehow, at some point, everything came together, and I realized that, my, Tanya, and here there was one, two, three, well, I won't say how many, And all this time you were acting with such a wonderful shoulder. You weren't the whipping girl you were five years ago anymore. Men no longer bully you in the sense that... Well, five years ago it was completely off the scale. I do not know whether such words can be used or not, but nevertheless. That is, you are no longer humiliated, you are not told that you are a schmuck, you are nobody. And there, your place is nowhere, you're ugly, they don't tell you that anymore.
Speaker A: That is... How do you feel now when you say that? You say such strong words about yourself.
Speaker B: Right now I'm speaking them calmly. I think a few years ago I would have just cried because they would have offended me. Now I know that's not the case. And, in fact, I have done a lot of work with myself and with a psychologist. When I realize that no, it's not like that, that I'm not ugly, I'm not worthless, there, well, that's it. Now, of course, I have a lot of this left, because, for example, I consider myself not a professional, it's very difficult for me to deal with this kind of plan. Well, I understand that it's kind of like this, it's already something not as toxic as it was five years ago. But now it seems to be from the other side. Again, the attitude is not about partnership, not about respect, that's how I want it, how I see it. And this attitude is about, well, listen to me, be my pillow, be my shoulder. And I don't like it either. And I'm like this, you know, Novoseltsev. A boy and another boy. Two boys. I don't want to talk about my man like that. I have a boy, another boy, two boys. This is wrong. I don't want that. I'm not physically bothered.
Speaker A: It sounds like you were in the past, there, five years ago, before therapy, as if you were so small in a relationship. And now you've become so very big. Well, as if from a child to parents.
Speaker B: Yes, yes. That is, five years ago it seemed to me that the optimal relationship with a man is a father-daughter relationship. Here he is for me, it seemed to me that this is a man in general, who I saw him as, this is such a prince, he means he rides on his own, he came and let's solve all Tanin's problems here, here I have finances, it's getting better altogether, and he's such a fist on the table, man, and so, and I was there, yes, well, yes, yes, but in the end it all came down to the fact that I also had a tyrant, like my dad, who told me there, you're no, well, in short, I don't want to repeat it all, it's all trash.
Speaker A: So in general, is this attitude familiar to you from childhood?
Speaker B: This is the relationship of my father with my mother, how he treated her and still treats her and still we have to do it all, well, we just have a lot of them.
Speaker A: And how much?
Speaker B: We have four children. And that's all of us... Well, okay, it's not us, I'm seeing it, unfortunately, now I'm more, because mom is always in the case of this... My dad suffers from a very alcohol addiction, and my mom always turns to me, that's the only one... And here, too, I can't build a border, because I don't really want to rattle my mom sometimes. I understand that yes, this is my conscious choice, this is my mother. Do you know how Gilbert Grape will be laid, here he is, I remembered something about him today, like this, yes, I should.
Speaker A: This is probably for Mom... You use a lot of metaphors today in general.
Speaker B: Yes, well, I generally like this metaphor in speech, it's more convenient for me, for some reason it's clearer. And this is my conscious choice, but sometimes I don't want to, I think, why not? I can't say, turn to my sister, she has a separate room there, you can sometimes stay with her, and not sleep with me on the couch. I don't know, it's probably wrong.
Speaker A: � So it's as if you continue to be included in dad's addiction, in the relationship of parents?
Speaker B: � Yes, yes. What was our situation like? We generally have, well, a small flashback there, we had a situation that was not very healthy, we had four children, but somehow I was the only one involved in all this. In general, the memories are standard from my childhood. Once every two weeks, already knowing by some signs that Dad would get drunk today, I went to bed, but did not fall asleep. I didn't fall asleep until he came home. And then my task was the following. I was supposed to be standing at the door. Nobody told me, you have to. I got up myself. I listened with my ear. As soon as I heard a blow, I ran in, covered my mother with me, because my father was beating her. I had to get up like a shield alive, well, because he didn't hit me. I knew perfectly well that I wouldn't get it, that I was a beloved daughter. After that, my task was to take my father somewhere, calm him down, calm him down. At the same time, I knew that now I would have to say, Mom is bad, mom is not good. And I would swear on the Bible, honestly.
Speaker A: Did he need to say that? To calm you down?
Speaker B: To calm him down. That is, he told me how bad she was, I confirmed everything. Because I need to calm down an angry, drunk, huge, adult man. Because if I calm down during the day, she will now get hurt, and now, perhaps, if someone else wakes up, one of my brothers or sisters will also get hurt. That was my task. That's my plan.
Speaker A: How old were you?
Speaker B: Well, I began to realize that my father was drinking, that it was something wrong. I was about six years old. About eight years ago I took a knife and sat one night with a knife, waiting for him. Then, it seems to me, that's when, as they describe the state of affect, I was in it. You.
Speaker A: Did you want to harm him in some way? Yes, he beat up Mom.
Speaker B: I calmed him down, washed his blood. I went and washed the landing, God forbid the neighbors find out. And after that, I went up to my mom and said that's it, now I'm going to protect you. She was sobbing, Mister was sobbing. I realized that I had to be stronger. I took a knife and sat down by the door. I was waiting for my father. I was clearly aware that at the age of 14 I would not be criminally liable. I will take all the blame on myself. I was reading a medical encyclopedia, I looked like muscles, I understood what muscles look like, I imagined how a knife cuts through these muscles, now he had to get these two with a knife if he came back. And, returning to this story, now I'm 34 years old for a minute, I don't have to go far, a week ago, I call it, my dad gave out salmon again, my mom suddenly showed up on the doorstep of my apartment, at 10 pm some day, when, frankly, my one desire was to lie down and In general, just die because I'm tired. My son was staying with them, unfortunately, he also saw all this trash. They came, and that's what I told my mom at 34, about what I told her for 8 years. I said, Mom, I'm going to emigrate, give me some time to settle in the States, I'll move you, I'll protect you, and you'll live with me, I'll get you out of here. I thought, Tanya, my, it's been 20, what, 26, I'm not much into math, you kind of, maybe that was some kind of trigger, you kind of already said it somewhere, that's just probably not enough knife, there there is no dad, you live separately from him, he won't go anymore. That is, I sort of, and we are still there, at the same point, While I still had a very unhealthy relationship with my father, in which I, it turns out, was such a beloved wife to him. I calmed him down, comforted him. We didn't have a sexual relationship, thank God. But I calmed him down, I comforted him. I was his joy, his consolation. And I wanted to have a personal life. Well, it seems to me that the fact that I am a single person, in principle, suits my parents very well. I can be put between during conflicts. For example, my father, in many ways, while we had a breakup there, perceived my son as his child. That is, he even wanted me to give him a patronymic like mine, Yurievna. He perceived him very much as his son. Thank you for giving birth to him, he told me when I gave birth to him by sound, by the way. not a blood boy. It seemed to me that I came out of all this, but here I am again, like, a mom, I will protect you again, I will protect you, and I will do it all, although my mom has two huge adult sons and a daughter who has a separate room with a sofa, she is still there in the very place on the sofa. Some kind of situation like this, when I don't say no. And I don't say "no" to everyone, it turns out.
Speaker A: You know, when you were telling all this now, I caught myself thinking that... That I feel very sorry for that girl, an eight-year-old, who, in general, was not allowed to be a girl.
Speaker B: Oh, it's in general, of course...
Speaker A: Who needed to be a parent for her parents at the age of 6-8. To save Mom. Reassure Dad. To defend some frontiers. I'm really sorry about that girl.
Speaker B: But, to be honest, I like her... Now, at some point, I just started to feel sorry for her and started to forgive her, because, I'll be honest, and I still don't always forgive myself for the fact that some nights I couldn't go out. I didn't have the courage to stand up. It's like the night they beat me with a belt... It's scary.
Speaker A: Do you feel guilty about it?
Speaker B: It's very. And I still feel guilty, even though I don't think I should. It's not my fault that... Well, my, it was like that. Here. Well, that's what happened. I don't know, at that moment I didn't think that I had done something, you know, from above. That's how these kids who grow up there. My dad is such an alcoholic, such a businessman. He drove up in a car, they gave him a lift, you know, a rich guy who drinks. And there are those that children collect in bottles on the street and try to dump in the trash. They don't think they're living in some kind of trash. They survive here and now. And that's when I was surviving here and now. For example, I don't feel guilty that I said nasty things about my mom. I had to survive and get them out. And everything. But sometimes I feel guilty that I didn't go out there when they beat me with a belt, because it was really scary with a belt. Here I stood moralized by fear. With a fist, you know, it's different, it wasn't like that. There are gradations.
Speaker A: You know, I am very sorry that you have to know the gradations of what is scarier and more painful with a fist or a belt.
Speaker B: Well, it's some kind of trash, I mean, well, you can't move at all. It's just a paralyzed fear. It's embarrassing, it's scary. And I forgave Dad, I forgave Mom. And even I kind of myself, kind of forgave myself, too. And now I already understand that no, I was not the guilty child. It's scary when... So it's okay that I didn't come out. Well, it seems like I've forgiven everyone, and it seems like I've lived through this situation. But I didn't live her year, it turns out. And it affects... Or maybe it doesn't affect the rest of my life, maybe. I mean relationships with men, in particular, I have a very painful moment.
Speaker A: It seems to me that there is a very important stage between the situation and forgiveness, which, in my opinion, you are missing. This anger. Because actually, everything that happened to you should cause a lot of anger.
Speaker B: It called me at one time. And even, you know, I stopped communicating with my father altogether. As much as a few months. I even told him everything directly. To be honest, it doesn't even matter to me now whether he understood or didn't understand. He didn't understand, by the way. I was very angry with my mother. Now I understand. Now they are elderly people for me. who suddenly passed abruptly. They're so old, they're so old.
Speaker A: And how old are they?
Speaker B: It's my dad, he's 64, but at some point I saw that he was probably alcoholic and, in short, such a not very lifestyle. I'm doing my job, because at some point, at some point, I realized that he was quite frail. And my mom started complaining to me recently about any changes in the brain, come on, I'm not related to anything. Her father died instantly from a stroke, or something. In general, I understand that it's like, well, I don't know, she thinks that the same fate is in store for her, and she's measured out some small interval for herself, in that he died before 70, and she's 63, something like that. I don't know how it is, yes. Although it seems like I'm just, you know, watching a TV series called "Life", where a woman in 70 is afraid of her husband, that's it, you're such an abuser, such and such, 70 days, that's it, I left, but it's not about my parents. No, they live there.
Speaker A: As if it were a load-bearing wall. This is the whole conflict, this alcoholism, this triangle of yours with mixed roles.
Speaker B: And you know, I sometimes think that maybe this is my emigration, emigration, it's such a way, of course, it's a way to fulfill my old dream, I'm not arguing here, but just a way to merge, to get out of this triangle, because I have a feeling that it's already from there, from the States, no one will ever be able to get me.
Speaker A: At the same time, you said a little earlier that you were already offering your mother to take her away.
Speaker B: Yes, I think, though, because there won't be this straight line between them, sort of, that is, well, I don't know, that was it.
Speaker A: Listen, and my question may be strange. Does Mom want to be rescued? She kind of lives like this all her life.
Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes. On the one hand, she wants to. And in general, on the one hand, she seems to want to leave there. But, on the other hand, it's, of course, it's all a check, in fact. This appeals to the fact that he will get us, and she feels sorry for us. I beg you, adults, how will he bother us? I go on by myself then. Well, I don't know, in general, she appeals to this.
Speaker A: Now, and you haven't answered. Do you think Mom wants to be rescued? In reality?
Speaker B: No, I think she's happy with this kind of life, because after fits of rage she gets gifts, and she doesn't want to look for another man, I mean. Or in general, in general, she survives. She thinks I'm measured out a little, and.
Speaker A: Now they are too. That is, it is such an interdependent system, when she tolerates something for a long time, then the father does something to the salmon, as you said, and then he gives her something out of guilt, and as if there is such satisfaction.
Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes. That is, these cars, a country house, some of her clothes, fitness, clinicians, it's all, you know, mostly with my father's money, which he earns.
Speaker A: And, at the same time, do they live well enough?
Speaker B: Well, they live, yes, quite thoroughly. Here.
Speaker A: And how� And how do you feel when you say out loud that your mom probably doesn't want to be rescued?
Speaker B: Well, you know, I can't say it's some kind of contempt. Maybe, yes, some� Although... contempt. Well, you know, like people who complain, complain about something, but are not ready to take responsibility and get out of some situation there. I complain that my job is shit, but I've been sitting for years, yes, and I don't quit this job. Well, damn it, who's to blame? You, why aren't you leaving? Or that's what, your boss, well, go then. And here is the same situation that� For me, this is a person who does not want to solve this problem then, and he chooses like this. That's his choice.
Speaker A: Well and... And she's been choosing this way for forty, thirty-five years.
Speaker B: For thirty-five years, she chooses like this. And at some point I decided that yes, okay, this is your life, your choice to drink, your choice to be a victim, to live with a tormentor. Okay, I'm not.
Speaker A: Are you in their crowd?
Speaker B: I'm actually in their party, because when I get a call from my mom at 10 p.m., I can't say, listen, no. Nothing inside me allows me to say no. Although I want to say no, my, no.
Speaker A: Why do you think you can't do it?
Speaker B: Because it's mom, because I really love my mom. I can't do anything with this mom.
Speaker A: Can I suggest an alternative option? What, maybe if you say "no", then you will experience a very strong sense of guilt?
Speaker B: Yes, terrible, terrible.
Speaker A: You will leave Mom.
Speaker B: I'll leave my mom. And I also like the fact that when I tried to discuss this situation with my brothers and sister, they say, "well, no, this must be tolerated, this is your mother, we, our mother, we are obliged, so we owe her a taste of life." I think, well, yes, yes, yes. But somehow Ignat, this is my son, Here he is looking at it, and he is also to me, I think, let's go somewhere. Although I think, well, let's go, I'll go from three miles. I'm ashamed, I'm really ashamed to send, well, to send Mom.
Speaker A: And so, if you somehow try to look at what is happening from an adult state, do you really consider yourself responsible for what is happening? Do you really think that you are responsible for Mom's fate?
Speaker B: Yes, the thing is that I am an adult who lives his life separately. I even have a separate family. And these are two adults who also live their lives separately from me. I am not dependent on them in any way, neither financially, nor housing, nothing. In principle, these are people who, yes, are responsible for themselves. Well, in general, my separate day, in principle.
Speaker A: It probably shouldn't, somehow... And then the question. Would you like to have a different relationship with your parents? Would you like to be separate from their situation?
Speaker B: Yes. And that's why I was so surprised by this last story a week ago. It seemed to me that I was already separate. just separately. But in fact I'm not separate again.
Speaker A: And how do you feel about yourself, who can't cope with becoming separate from her parents? Do you somehow blame yourself for this?
Speaker B: Yes. And in general, it seems to me that I bomb me a lot in this life, when people don't take responsibility. Very bombed.
Speaker A: How is your mother, as you told me. Yes, yes.
Speaker B: In general, they don't take a beard anyway, because I myself don't take responsibility in many ways. And here I have the same thing. I don't like. I don't like this situation. I'm an orphan. I'm mad at myself.
Speaker A: Do you despise?
Speaker B: I think I am guilty of everything that has happened to me in my life. It's my fault. Or something like that. Something like that. Not so. And the same thing, if further separated. I'm to blame, for example. My actions lead to the fact that I have some kind of tension for my son, for a man. That is, I can't be responsible for something, but I can for something, and I'm not responsible for it. Here. And then the same thing happens.
Speaker A: You're so close to a whisper right now.
Speaker B: Yes?
Speaker A: What is the reason for this?
Speaker B: Oh, I don't know. It's so with me inside.
Speaker A: It's you, when you started talking about your responsibility, you started talking almost in a whisper.
Speaker B: Well... yes. But this, this, this is internal. No, it's certainly not. I don't like it. I don't like that I can't take responsibility. I don't like that I can't say a word. I don't like that I often can't stand up for myself. And it scares me especially now, taking into account, again, microaction. I will go to another continent, where I will be completely alone. alone in the field of wars, and everything will stand up for me. That's it, no one, there will be no one, no one. And I, and I, I have problems with taking responsibility, I have problems with saying no.
Speaker A: I, oddly enough, it doesn't seem to me that you have a problem taking responsibility. You bear a lot of responsibility for your mother, for your father, for your son, for men, for emigration. It's like you don't know how, you don't know how not to take responsibility, but it sounds corny. You don't know how to take it off.
Speaker B: I can't do it at all. I don't know how to be bad at all. I think it's probably because I don't want to be bad. I want to be good, I want to be patient.
Speaker A: Like who?
Speaker B: Like a good person, that's the kind of person. But there again, you see, we all come back to that... But if you're good, I'll love you. And if you're not good, I won't love you. I had such a rather cold mother. And there is a very cold one. And there... I try and try all the time. And I'm trying. And my, how can I tell you, manifestations of the real me, because I'm still, of course, still hysterical, I'm so cool, just unreal. Probably only my son sees all this, because, wow, he's unrequited, there's nothing to hide.
Speaker A: He can't say no.
Speaker B: But he is there, he is already calmly perceiving, he says, I understand that you will get through, and in five minutes everything will be fine. Here. That's why I can't. I don't know, I'm ashamed, I don't want to. I take responsibility cheerfully for the whole party. I'm ashamed to send now, to send my mother. I'm really ashamed, I feel sorry for her. It turns out, yes. I understand that she's kind of an adult, but she's like a child. She's like a child.
Speaker A: Have you ever been mad at her?
Speaker B: For Mom? Absolutely. I even tell her how angry I am. For the fact that she bullied me, for the fact that she didn't leave. I gave birth to four from this dude. Although it was possible not to do it. Steel on three, if you were killed during your first pregnancy. Well, what are you thinking about? Here. Very angry. I was just terribly angry. And... I don't know, we probably are very... For about a year we have been in such circuits. And then already... Our relationship has become better, in principle. Now they are quite normal, as they say. Inatsa was very angry. We communicated very well with my father. I don't like to call him.
Speaker A: What would your request sound like if we had more meetings?
Speaker B: I think my request sounds like, well, learn to say no.
Speaker A: Because... Mom?
Speaker B: Generally to everyone. Here there are people who are not human, I am a yes person. Yes to everyone. Yes, Mom, yes, Dad, yes, employer, you know, yes, Ignat, sit on your head, yes, yes, yes, dear, I'll listen to all your 350 koristey, yes, yes, yes. It turns out that yes, in a moment of incomprehension, I always find some excuses. And even if I understand that they are starting to bomb, I am very comfortable, but at the moment I find some excuses, I say, well, of course, yes, and then in fact something is already wrong, something is wrong, and this cop, I can never take on myself track the situation around. I guess I think this is my request.
Speaker A: Are you afraid to say "no" if I understand correctly?
Speaker B: I'm afraid to say "no", and often I don't understand myself that I should have said "no" here for a minute. No, I'm not going on a date with you at minus 30 to walk down the street, because you're a gorgeous woman, minus 30, you're going to freeze me now. No, I'm not going to do this extra work that I'm owed. They won't give me a bonus for it. However, there is no functionality. And at the moment I don't understand what is wrong. Don't talk. What should I say? No. And then, you know, you didn't get high at all. You knew yourself that you didn't get high.
Speaker A: Besides the fact that it's hard for you to say no, you don't really understand your feelings yet.
Speaker B: I never understand my feelings. That's it, stop and listen. How do you like it now? I don't know how. And what do you want? I never know what I want.
Speaker A: Listen, but at the same time, when you talk about all these situations now, well, they somehow sound absolutely clear, and you have a clear understanding of what exactly you don't like.
Speaker B: Because I then sit, I analyze, I, for example, keep a diary, I write down a lot. And when I write it down, analyze it, I say, oh, but right there it was. Or I have such a chat with a girlfriend, I call Zarya Medasa, with people ears. Where am I going, that's right, that's all I was boiling, I tell her, and while I'm saying these whatsapp messages, I understand, my, so it's like this, Tanya, I don't need an answer, friends, I kind of understand myself.
Speaker A: But at the moment... You see, I'm interested, I remembered what you started the meeting with today. About the fact that in general your rhythm of life, it's about running somewhere 24 to 7, drinking wine and phenibut. And you talked about running away from something.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: And it seems to me that if you run at such a speed, then there is no place at all to think about what you want, what you don't want.
Speaker B: Never. Therefore, this emigration is for me, you know, this is what I need in general, I'm like a weed in general, and it's not bad in Russia either. I'm already thinking, here I ran, I should run then. We run for the sake of... And if I stop, then I have to text my girlfriend right now, she doesn't help. Well.
Speaker A: Once again, I don't understand, I don't understand.
Speaker B: Well, you know, if you stop right now, say, that's it, goodbye, she still has.
Speaker A: No, no, look, it's not necessary to say goodbye to New York. The question is precisely in your pattern of behavior, that you run somewhere very quickly, drown out the feeling with wine and phenibut, and this approach itself, it allows me to feel complex feelings, including aggression, probably.
Speaker B: Aggression, I suppress it so much, first of all, I suppress aggression so much. Now it's mainly there in relation to my son, because I'm leaking, I'm trying very hard to suppress negative emotions. A lot of what I think about causes me negative emotions. Tears, if they are negative emotions, are the weakest of them. Here.
Speaker A: That is, if you reformulate your request, it would sound not about learning to say "no" to you, but about slowing down to feel anything at all.
Speaker B: Well, it's very important, yes. I generally want to... And then, if further, just learn to aggress without fear. Because I don't know how to do it. I do not know how to drain all this negativity.
Speaker A: Well, so far it turns out that you seem to project it on yourself. You blame yourself, you get angry at yourself, you drink phenibut yourself. Well, that is, as if...
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Difficult relationship with mom, there is a difficult relationship with dad. But it's better not to get into them. It is better to take all this on yourself and take responsibility for it all. And stifle your feelings.
Speaker B: Yes, it turns out, in fact, everything is exactly like that. That is, yes, it turns out that I just drown them out, they have some kind of negative, I try to do it all... I can't solve it, it's their relationship. I can't, like, get out of them. Although, damn, yes, I do not know how to get out of this. I'm drowning out the clearing.
Speaker A: The clearing silences well.
Speaker B: And somehow, somehow, yes.
Speaker A: Somehow it turns out like this. Can I ask you now to take a couple of deep breaths? Straight, so, full lungs.
Speaker B: Well, yes.
Speaker A: How do you feel?
Speaker B: Well, these are actually such breaths, this is when you cry and then breathe like that-breathe, something like that. Here. You'll breathe.
Speaker A: You can still breathe in order to cry. To slow down a bit.
Speaker B: Maybe. But I didn't want to cry at all.
Speaker A: I understand.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Do you want to?
Speaker B: Well, in general, I often have a contract with me.
Speaker A: Do you want to right now?
Speaker B: Wants to. And often wants to. She just says that I will come now, I will put the baby down, then there is time, let her watch then. And I just, to be honest, very often pass out by that time.
Speaker A: You put a lot of effort into not crying. You are even now so... trying to hold back the tears. I understand that there is a context of our meeting, and that it is difficult to cry on camera. I understand all this.
Speaker B: Yes, it's difficult. It just seems to me that when I cry, such whining, it's unconstructive. This is unconstructive. To do one-two-three is probably constructive. Cry a lot. Well, that's the point, it's like when I was a kid, when I told my mom, what's the point that you're crying now? Come on, come on, that's the point of swimming now? I'll go now, I'll protect everything now. All. There will be no scissors business.
Speaker A: Well, constructive is about adulthood. And tears are about fragility. It's about something that your parents deprived you of in your childhood. I have a lot of sympathy wakes up, appears. And I am very sorry that this happened to you.
Speaker B: You are... oh.
Speaker A: It was, it passed, but it didn't pass inside you. This is something that you have pushed so far and put a lot of effort not to move. At the same time, it is something that manifests itself in your own relationships, with your men, with your child. It's something from the past.
Speaker B: Well, yes, it turns out that it is. That is, for some reason it seemed to me that everything, I had already experienced it, died, and that was it.
Speaker A: We are running out of time. I think this is a good place to put a comma in our conversation. It would be important for me to hear some feedback from you about our meeting, about whether you managed to do something for yourself during these 50 minutes?
Speaker B: Listen, well, first of all, how can I tell you, at some point, I'm just working with LGBT people now, I hear so many stories, well, what kind of trash, what did you have as a child, well, dad didn't care a little, mom, well. Well, something like that, you know, I think, well, what are you really running around with this stuff?
Speaker A: Here you devalue, yes?
Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes. I understand that no, that it turns out to be... I thought it was all gone, that's what. That's what I've learned for myself, that it hasn't gone anywhere. I spent four years in therapy, but it somehow helped me to resolve it from some side, but it turns out that it has not gone anywhere, and it turns out that it is still with me. unfortunately. And this is the main thing that I actually realized for myself. About that and, probably, about the fact that I absolutely do not allow myself. Well, here's some kind of fragility, I don't know, weakness. I thought I was weak, but, probably, on the contrary, I really don't allow myself to be weak.
Speaker A: It seems to me that you are getting closer to this today.
Speaker B: I really hope that it is impossible to carry this all my life. Can you imagine, 34 years to drag. Impossible. Probably something like that. Good.
Speaker A: Let's end here. Thank you.
Speaker B: Thank you very much. A very important conversation. I had, I really have something to help you after analyzing.
Speaker A: How are you? Thank you.
